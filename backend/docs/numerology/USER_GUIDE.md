## FAQ

### Q: Which system should I use - Western or Vedic?
**A**: Both! They offer different insights. Western focuses on life path and name vibrations, while Vedic connects numbers to planetary energies. Use "Both" to get the complete picture.

### Q: Should I use my birth name or current name?
**A**: For Life Path calculations, always use your birth date. For name-based numbers (Expression, Soul Urge), use your full birth name. You can create name trials for current names or nicknames.

### Q: What if I was adopted and don't know my birth name?
**A**: Use the name you've always known yourself by. The vibration you've lived with is what matters.

### Q: Are Master Numbers better than single digits?
**A**: Not necessarily. Master Numbers (11, 22, 33) offer higher potential but also greater challenges. They require more discipline and can be overwhelming. Some people with Master Numbers actually resonate more with the reduced number (2, 4, 6).

### Q: What is Karmic Debt?
**A**: Karmic Debt numbers (13, 14, 16, 19) appear in your calculation when you have specific lessons to learn. They indicate areas where you may face challenges that require conscious effort to overcome.

### Q: How often should I check my Personal Year/Month/Day?
**A**: Your Personal Year changes once per year (on your birthday). Check it at the beginning of each year to understand the year's theme. Personal Month changes monthly, and Personal Day changes daily - check these as needed for important decisions or planning.

### Q: Can numerology predict the future?
**A**: Numerology doesn't predict specific events. Instead, it reveals trends, cycles, and energies. Think of it as a weather forecast - it tells you the conditions, but you decide how to navigate them.

### Q: Should I change my name if I don't like my numbers?
**A**: Major name changes should be carefully considered. Your birth name carries the energy you came into this life with. However, name trials can help you understand how variations affect your vibration without committing to a legal change.

### Q: What if my Life Path is different in Western vs. Vedic?
**A**: This is normal! The systems use different calculations. Western Life Path comes from your full birth date, while Vedic Destiny Number uses a different reduction method. Both are valid and offer complementary insights.

### Q: How accurate is numerology?
**A**: Numerology is a tool for self-understanding, not a science. Its "accuracy" depends on how well the descriptions resonate with you. Use it as a guide for self-reflection and personal growth.

### Q: Can two people have the same Life Path but be different?
**A**: Absolutely! Life Path is just one number. Your complete numerology chart includes Expression, Soul Urge, Personality, Birth Day, and more. The combination creates your unique blueprint.

### Q: What's the most important number?
**A**: Your Life Path Number is considered the most significant as it represents your core purpose. However, all core numbers work together to create your complete numerological profile.
