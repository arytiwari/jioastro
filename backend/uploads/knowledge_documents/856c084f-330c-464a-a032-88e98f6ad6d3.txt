InVEDA.NGA JYOTISA OF LAGADH AEdited and TranslatedFOREWORD    The Ved{Jliga Jyoti$a of sage Lagadha is highly ?ignificant in the history of science in India, in the sense that it is the earliest full-fledged treatise on Iodian astronomy. As an adjunct to the Vedic lore, it forms a manual for the determination of rituals and sacrifices by the Vedic priest and for the preparation of a handy calendar for social and religious events. The work is current in two recensions, one in 36 verses related to the ]Jgveda and the other in 43 verses related to the Yajurreda, most of the verses in the two texts being common.    Several attempts have been made earlier to edit and interpret this porular text. However, the fact that the work was but a manual and not self-contained, and that there was much to be learnt from tradition anrJ practice to\\-ards a correct under-standing and interpretation of this cryptic text has made all the earlier attempts suffer from some inherent limitation or the other.    As such, it is a matter for gratification that the late Prof. T. S. Kuppanna Sastry took up the task of preparing a te:dual study and rational interpretation of the work. He combined in himself erudition in Vedic tradition, knowledge of Indian astronomy and was equipped in modern mathematics. The draft he had left before he passed a\vay in 1978 required to be edited and made press-worthy. Moreover, the Sanskrit text needed to be critically edited from original manuscripts, and the necessary indices etc. prepared, to make the publication academically acceptable. This additional work has been donCl in a scholarly manner by Dr. K. V. Sarma of the Kuppuswami Sastri Research Institute, Madras.{n placing before discerning scholars of Sanskrit and Science the ancient text ofVedG/1ga Jyofi$a, I have great pleasure in recording my ?ineere thanks to the sons of late Prof. Sastry for making available their fatherás erudite work for publication by the lndian National Science Academy and to Dr. K.

Studies VERSE (Piida) INDEX GtNERAL hDEXPREFACE    Vediiliga Jyoti:Ja (VJ), 'the astronomical auxiliary of the Vedas', of which a critical edition with translation and detailed exposition is being issued through this publication, is the earliest Indian text devoted exclusively to the treatment of astronomy. The work is traced back to the teachings of sage Lagadha (c. 1180 B. c:.) and is current in two recensions exhibiting but minor differences, one pertaining to the fl.greda (R-VJ) and the other to the Yajurveda (Y-VJ) and cal!ed, respectively, Arca-Jyoti1a and Yciju,m-Jyoti,m. The work had, primarily, been intended as a manua! for tl1e determination of the times for rituals and allied purposes, for the use of the Vedic priests who supple-mented it, as needed, with the concepts and practices imbibed hy them by tradition. This latter aspect, coupled with the fact that the work is only a handbook and not a full-fledged self-contained treatise on the subject, has rendered the correct understand-ing of several passages in it difficult, for things not specifically defined in the text have to be known through traditional knowledge and practice. Particularly for this reason, the present translation and detailed exposition of the work with .imple application of modern astronomy. by late Prof. T. S. Kuppanna Sastry should be \\elcome, for he combined in him?elf three qualities essential for the task, viz. ?ound ?cholarship in Sanskrit, good knowledge of Western astronomy and foll understanding of the concepts and practices of traditional Hindu astronomy.    The Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan provided Prof. Sastry with a proper forum for placing his exposition before scholars for their adjudgement. The Bhavan organised in Bombay, on March 24-25, 1979, a 'Workshop on Ancient Astronomy' under its project on 'Ancient Insights and Modern Discoveries', a project which had been envisaged by them as a co-operative national endeavour to explore the possibilities of a meaningful correlation of ancient Indian insights and thoughts and the modern scientific dis-coveries and technical achievements. In fact, the Vedas, the Upani?áads, the Puriif)as and several other works on various subjects in ancient languages would now seem to stand up to the more critical inquiry and examination of a modern scientific mind, as more and more discoveries of modern times are found to have relevant parallel references in the teachings of early Indian sages. The subject has been, for quite some time now, engaging the atlention of scientists with a Sanskrit background and Sans-kritists with a scientific background to make a meaningful correlation between the two. Towards the achievement of this laudable objective, the Bhavan has taken several steps including the establishment of contacts with scholars of the type mentioned above, institution of studies and researches of an inter-disciplinary nature and organisa-tion of seminars and workshops towards providing a forum for discussions and mutual exchange of ideas in the different disciplines. It is pertinent to record that Vedii1iga Jyotila and its present exposition was set out on the occasion of the first Workshop on Ancient Indian Astronomy organised by the Bhavan under its auspices as a part of its project noticed above. In fact, later, Prof. Sastry had expre?sed a desire to have his work published by the Bhavan, and the latter had included it in its publication pro-gramme. It was subsequently felt that it would be befitting if this work were to be8	VI:D.:...i.:GA ]YOTI?Aissued through the Indian National Science Academy, for two reasons, first, on account of this being a work on a scientific discipline and secondly the cu,rent year 1984-85 being the Jubilee Year of the Academy, a suggestion made on behalf of the Academy and accepted by the Bhavan. It is to be hoped that this decision would be acclaimed by the scholarly world.    The Vediil1ga Jyoti?áa, being just a handbook, does not present its contents always in a systematically arranged manner as is the case with later texts on astronomy. As a result, topics on the same subject often find themselves distributed in different places in the work and vice versa. In order to enable the understanding of the astronomical knowledge contained in the work in a compact way, the Text, Translation and Exposi-tion in this publication are presented in the undermentioned manner.    In Part A, the Sk and Yajur recemions, R-VJ and Y-VJ, of the Vediiliga JyatiJa have been separately edifed from a critical point of view on the basis of 20 manuscripts including those whose readings are recorded by A. Weber in his 'Ober den Vedakalendar, namens Jyotishamá, (Abh. Berliner Ak. der Wiss, 1862, 1-130). The corruptnes? of certain passages have necessitated emendations which have been so couched as to suit the available lettering in the manuscripts, the context and the meaning, and have been placed within brackets. The justification of the emendations have been made later in the exposition of the verses in Part B of this publication.    The undermentioned manuscripts have been collated towards constituting the Critical Text of VJ given in Pt. A. The abbreviations used herein are: DNg.=Deva-nii.gari, Gr.=Grantha, Tel.=Telugu; PL= Palmleaf; Pr.=Paper; and Cm.=Complete.Sk-Vedii,iga Jyoti,wA  and B. No. 1505, Verseichniss der Ski. und.

Modern copies procured by Weber and used in his edition.    Part B is devoted to the Translation and the Exposition of the VJ and to the demonstration of the principles and practices involved by means of worked out eumples. Herein the VJ verses have been classified into five Sections according to the topics dealt with by them. Since most of the verses in the two recensions are common, both are translated and explained together. Thus against the common verses would be given both the R-VJ and Y-VJreferences, while verses occurring in only one oft he recensions will have the references only to the respective recension. The following are the sections under which the verses have been classified: {i) Benediction and Valediction; (ii) Measures of Time, Asterisms etc.; (iii) Fundamental and derived Yuga constants; (iv) Tithi, NakJatra etc. of certain special days; and (v) Daily Tithi and Nak$afra and their risings and settings. The rules for the calculation of the days, parvas, daily tithis and nak,mtras included in the last section are not very obvious and the terms used are mostly undefined that these verses have been most difficult to understand. Successive scholars who have attempted to unravel the meaning and application of these verses have been successful in different degrees and most of them have left several of th.e verses as incomprel1ensible. The length to \'ihich some scholars, especially from the West, have been baffled as to have expressed themselves in a most unbecoming manner, with ignorance turned to anger and anguish, might be illustrated from a statement ofD. W. Whitney, when he says: "And when we come to add that the Jyottsha (VJ)has no definable place in Sanskrit literature, or relation to the Vedic ceremonial we shall see that this famous datum, which has seemed to promise so much, has caused so much labour and discussion, and is even yet clung to by some scholars as the sheet-anchor of ancient Hindu chronology, is nothing but a delusive phantom.'" (cf. his Oriental and Linguistic Studies, Second Series, New York, 1874, p. 384). May be, Prof. Sastry's rational interpretation of these- enigmatic 11erses would induce this Western Orientalist turn in his grave. It goes to the credit of Prof. Sastry to have tackled the VJ in its entirety and to have been able to give satisfactory interpretations to all its verses, which, perhaps, is the most convincing of what have been given thus far by scholars who have attempted the task.    I might close this Preface with a personal note. It would seem that a wish expres<.ed by Prof. Sastry, more than five years ago, finds fruition at this moment. In a letter dated March 3, 1979, he wrote to me: "Dear Sharma, .... Regarding the Vedanga edition, Dr. Abraham (of the Christian College, Madras) and Dr. Ansari (of the A. M. University Aligarh), asked me to get it published by the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan.... Otherwise, I would have wished it to be done by you, because if I simply send the manus-10	YEO \.?GA JYOTJ<;Acript to you, you would hare done everything else." Having the highest regard for Prof. Sastry and appreciation for the confidence that he had been placing on me during our dose academic relationship for nearly 30 years, I am happy that my associa-tion which he had wished for in the edition and publication of the Vediiliga Jyoti,rn has ultimately been fulfilled, though under circumstances not envisaged by him.The present Translation and Notes of VedQli,ga JyotiJa has been prepared on theha,is of the draft thereof and the related papers left by Prof. Sastry with his son Dr.T. K. Balsubramanian, Scientist, BARC, Bombay, who placed them in my bands, for their edition and publication through a common friend, Shri S. Hariharan, Executive Director, LIC, Bombay, who, besides, was an admirer of Prof. Sastry. I am thankful to both these friends in the matter. My thanks are due also to the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan and the Indian National Science Academy, the former for agreeing to publish the book, in the first instance, and the latter for actually publishing the work under their au?pice? during their Golden Jubilee Year.Adyar, Madras,	K. V. SARMASriiva,:ia-piir,;imii, The Samkrit Day, August 11. I984TNTRODUCTION1. Astronomy of the Vedic Sar,1hitiis    The VedOligo-JyotiJa (VJ) belongs to the late Vedic age. Even during the time oft he early mal)(ialas of the ]J.gveda astronomical information necessary for the day to day life of the people, like the knowle<lge of the seasons for sowing, reaping etc., had been acquired, as among all ancient peoples. Information required for the religious life of the people, like the timc-s of full and new moons, tl1c last disappearance of the moon and its first appearance etc., nece,,.ary for the monthly rites like the Dar.fopiir(wm,7.w and seasonal rites like Ciiwrmii:.ya, had also been acqui,ed.1 Th( names of the moon's asterisms (27) were known and used to indicate day?.2 There are vestiges in the shape oft he Vedic legends and names of asterisms to show the antiquity of particular mantras. For instance, Agrahiiyn{la, an old name for the asterism MrgaHr,rn, meaning 'beginning of the year', points to the fourth millennium B.C. when the sun was there at the vernal equinox. The RohiQi legends point to a time in the !ate JJ.gvedir period when the point shifted to the asterism RohiQi.3 The later sacrificial session ca!!ed Gawimayana was especially designed for the daily observation of the movements of the sun and of the dis.appearance of the- moon, and this must have given the priests suffi´ ciently precise knowledge about the astronomical elements. We have evidence to show that even knowledge of a special kind, like the saras of the Greeks, for predicting the solar eclipse, was possc-ssed by the priests of the Atri family.4    The above type of knowle<lge improved with time, so that in the Yqjum?da period we can say with certainty that the following was well known: The solar year was known to have 365 days and a fraction more, though it was roughly spoken of as having 360 days, consisting of 12 months of 30 days each, Evidence for this is found in the Kná!Ja¥ Yajurveda: Taittiriya Sa,n.hitii (TS) 7.2.6, where the extra 11 days over the 12 lunar months, Caitra, VaiSakha etc., totalHng 354 days, is mentioned to complete the rtus by the performance of the Ekiidafonitra or eleven-day sacrifice.5 TS 7.! .10 says that 5 days more were required over the Siivana year of 360 days to complete the seasons, adding that 4 days are too short and 6 days too long.6 Further, five years were found to form ayuga, the names of the years thereof being Samvatsara. Parfratsara, ldJ.vatsara, Anuvatsara and Jdvatsara.' This yuga was used to reckon time, as seen from ?ucl1 statements as 'Dirghatamas, son of Mama ta, became old even in his tenth yuga', i.e. between the age of 45 and 50.?Even earlier, the two interca\ary months, called A,n.haspati and Sa,n.sarpa, required to complete the yuga, were known, as seen from the ?tatement redo miisii dhrtavato d1¥iidafa prajifrata};/1'edb ya upajJ.yate/1 (RV 1.25.8).    The six rtus in the solar year, with the names of the twelve tropical months, are given by the statement:Madhuica MiidhavaSCa ViisantikiivrtU, Sukrafra Sud.fro Grai?miivrtU, Nabha.fra NabhasyaSCa Viir#kiivrtU, ]$afro Orjafra SiiradtivrtU, Sahafca Sahasya.fra HaimantikiivrtU, Tapaica Tapasyafca SaiiiriivrtU (TS 4.4.11.1; Viijasnneyi Sat11hitii (VS) 13.14).12	VEn.\..::GA JYOTl$A    It might also be seen that the sacrificial year commenced with Vasanta (spring). It had also been noted that the s.hortest day was at winter solstice when the seasonal year Siiira began with Uttariiya1)a (Kau,fitaki Briihma,:ia, 19.3) and rose to a maximum at the summer solstice.1. Datable Vedic paswges    It was observed that the moon came back to the same position in the zodiac once in about 27 days and that each day was marked by the aMerism or asterismal group (nak,wrra) near which the moon was seen, resulting in calling the asterism as the day's nak1a1ra, rrom which the 27 asterismal segments of the zodiac came into use. The names of these with their presiding deities are enumerated in the Yajurveda, beginning with Krttikii, where the spring equinox was situated at that period. The thirteen and a half 11ak,?atras ending with Vi.ffikhii, situated in the northern hemisphere, were called devanakJatras, while the thirteen and a half others ending with BharaT}.i were called yamanakJalras, as seen from the passage: Krtrikiil,, prathama,µ, Vi.?iikhe uttamam, tiini deva-nakJatriiT}.i. Anuriidhiib prathamam, ApabharaT}.ir uuamam, tiini yama-nak$af-riiT}.i ( Taitt. Brii.hmaT}.a, 1.5.2.7). Incidentally, this would give the age of the observation as C. 2300 B.C.    Another statement about the Krttikiis points to even an earlier period: Vide the passage: etU (Krttikii) ha vai priicyai di.fo na cyaranle, san'iiTJ.i ha rai anyiini nak$afriiT}.i priicyai diiaS cyavante (Sarapatha BriihmatJa, 2.1.2.3). This means that the asterismal group Krttikii. never swerve from the east, while the others do. The meaning is confirmed by Siiyarya's commentary. This points to c. 2950 B.C.    A far !at.er observation is reported in the MaitriiyaT}.iya BriihmaT}.a-Upani$ad, 6.14, to the effect that the winter solstice was at the mid-point of the Sravi${hii segment and the summer solstice at the beginning of Maghii. This points to c. 1660 B.C., a little before the period of the Vediiriga JyotiW    Even regular astronomer? ate mentioned by expressions like prajn.iiniiya nak$alra-darSam ( YV-VQjasaneyi Sa,rihirii, 30.10; Tait. Br., 3.4.4.1), and yiidase gatJakam (YV-Viij. Sar,t, 3.20; Taitt. Br., 3.4.15.1). A Nak$atra-vidyii(Science of the stars) is mentioned in the ChQndogya Upani$ad, 7.1.2.4; 2.1; 7.1. These references would give an idea of the astronomical knowledge which had been acquired before the time of VJ, on the basis of which the VJ has to be adjudged.1. Text of the Ved(]iiga Jyoti$a    Of the extant Indian astronomical texts, the VJ is the earliest. The astronomical matter forming the basis of the work is of one Lagadha, but the classical language employed in the work as current now would indicate that the original must have been redacted by a lat.er person belonging to the last centuries B.C. The same system as mentioned in the Yi is seen in the Mahiibhiirata, the earlier astronomical sarnhitiis like that of Garga etc., and the Paitiimaha Siddhiinta condensed by Variihamihira (VM) in his PaiicasiddhantikQ (PS). The VJ has come down in two recensions, one belongingINTRODUCTION	13to the ]Jgveda (R-VJ) and the other, which is later, larger and more advanced in its method?, to the Yajurveda (Y-VJ), though their basic content is almost the same. Later than these came the AtharvarJ,a Jyauti,Ya, attached to the Atharva Veda, called so just for the sake of uniformity. While the first two are astronomical, the third deals with the Muhiirta branch of astrology. While the first two purport to be based on Lagadha's science, the Athan'a!Ja says that it was taught by Pitiimaha to K.iiSyapa.1. Date of the Vediiliga JyotiJa    Verses 6, 7 and 8 of the Yajur-Vediiiiga Jyoti:;a (Y-VJ) show that at the time of Lagadha the winter solstice was at the beginning of the asterism Srovi$[hti (Delphini) segment and that the summer solstice was at the mid-point of the .A.f!C'$ii segment. It can be seen that this is the same as was alluded to by Varahamihira in his Pmicasiddhii11-tikii. and BrhatSaf!lhitii. Since VM has stated that in his own time the summer solstice was at Punarvasu 4, and the winter solstice at Uttar5fifrjhii. l, there had heen a preces-sion of l? stellar segments, i.e. 2r 20". From this we can compute that Lagadha's time was 72x23 l/3=1680 years earlier that VM's time (c. A.D. 530), i.e. c. 1150 B.C. If, instead of the segment, the group ibe\f is meant, which is about 3'' within it,Lagadha's time would be r. 1370 D.C.1. Verification of the date of Lagadha    The date arrived at as above can be conArmed by lhc SUryasiddliiinta and the Siddhiinta Siromaf,li which give 290¡ polar longitude and 36¡ polar latitude to 5'raiV$fhii. From this, the actual longitude of Sravi$[ha got is 296¡ 15'. Since the siddhantas use the fixed zodiac beginning with the vernal equinox of c. 550 A.D., and the winter solstice of this is 270¡, there has been a precession of 296¡ 15' minus 270¡=26¡ 15'. Since26}>:72= !890 years, the wanted time is 1890 years, before A.O. 550, i.e. t'. 1340 B.C., being the same as the above, the small difference being observational.    We can also calculate the time directly by comparing the position of Sravi$/hii (Q Delphini) at the time when the winter solstice was 27()(', with its position in 1940 A.O. (Rt, as. 20h 36m sis =3090 13', and declination 15¡ 42' N). In the figure: The obliquity is about 23¡ 40', r is the vernal equinox, S is Sravi,rfhii and R its Rt. as. position.s50á  47'	l'R f,!\----_::_::._.:c.:..		-::;,-c?"'c:::_-CELESTIAL E?UATOA .,_-,o, t:,,.0s'14	VtD,\XGA JYOTf?ARr=360¡-Rt. as. =500 47', RS is the declination=15¡ 42'. RS is the continuation ofSR up to the ecliptic. Now:    i. From the rt. angled spherical triangle RrS, it can be calculated that RS=i8¡ 46'; Sr=53¡ 13'; and angleL.5=75¡ 17'.    ii. From the rt. angled spherical triangles SS", S S"=9¡ 53', S" beingthecelesital longitude of Sin A.D. 1940. lt was 270¡ at the time required. Therefore, the precession is 3600-53' 13'-270¡+9¡ 53'=46¡ 40'. Multiplying by 72, the time is 3360 years before A.D. 1940, i.e. c. 1400 B.C. If the beginning of the segment is meant and Sravi$Jhii is about 3¡ inside, it is c. 1180 a.c. Since all these is subject to small errors of observa-tion, it would be noted that we have got from all almost the same date for VJ.    One may wonder why so much trouble is taken to prove this. It is because that late LO. Swamikannu Pillai has fixed the dale c. 850 IJ.C., after a lot of argument, in his Indian Ephemeris, vol. I, Pt. i. pp. 444-45. Trusting in the so-caJ!ed Drk-ga,;ita Paiicii1iga of the Kumbhakonam Mutt, in South India, he has accepted the precession in 1916 as about 22-?, with the spring equinox of about A.D. 550 as the first point of the fixed zodiac. This would give 22}>'.72=1620 years earlier than 1916 for the spring equinox or VM's time, i.e. c. A.D. 300. This difference of about 250 years is taken by Swamikannu Pillai as VM's observational error, since he has taken that VM's date is correctly A.D. 550. Proceeding from this, he argues that in about 1600 years there is an observational error of 250 years, and "allowing the same proportion of error for the previous epochs, the antiquity of Vedri1iga Jyotifa observation,   may also be reducedby 250/1620, i.e. by 2,113; in other words, from 3300 yea1s before now to 2792 years before now, i.e. from B.c. 1400 to B.c. 850." (ib., p. 445).    Nole here the strange lapse on the part of Pillai, taking that the error of observa-tion depends upon the time elapsed. On the other hand, it depends on the instruments used and the 'personal equation', and not "proportiontate" to the time elapsed. He has confused this with the error in the cylcles derived from previous observations, which error alone can accumulate with time.    Further, VM's observation was remarkably good. The vernal equinox was at the first point of the Indian zodiac, defined as being about IO' east of the 'Junction star' of Revati, which, from its co-ordinates given by the siddhii.ntas, must be identified with Zeta Piscium. All siddhrintas, explicitly or implicitly, take the precession to be zero at about this period and the vernal equinox was situated here at this period. So there was very little error of obsrevation on the part of VM, which is a remarkable thing. If so, the precession at 1916 should be about 19¡ since (1916-550)772=19. How, then, has this 221¡ precession arisen in the Tamil Drk almanac, it may be asked. This is how it has happened. All Hindu siddhii.ntas give a sidereal year in the neighbour-hood of 365-15-Jl-30 days, which is about 8? vinii<}is more than the correct sidereal period of the Sun. Since the Sun is taken to return to the first point of the Hindu Zodiac after each sidereal year, the first point of the Hindu zodiac itself has a precessional move-11\"TRODL:CTIOI'>	15roent (though taken to be fixed), and, reckoned from thi,á point, the rate of precession would be not the real 50". 25, but 50". 25 plus 8". 5=about 59". This enor of 8".5 has accumulated up to the time of the appearance of the Tamil Drk almanacs at the end of the last century, and when the Kumbhakona Mutt Paiiciiliga originated about a hundred years ago, the error had accumulated to more than 3¡. In order to fall in line with the siddhiinlic new year day and thus avoid popular outcry if the correct c. 19¡ precession were to be adopted, in which case the new year would have to be begun three days earlier, and also to avoid certain difficulties with the dharmaiiistras, this Drk Paficii1iga tacitly adopted a prece?sion of !911 plus 3o...,_22n. to hide the fact that the Drk system was an innovation and to create the impression that it had be.!n in existence from time immemorial. Thi? had Jed Pillai to this error in judging the period of the VJ.91. Contents of the Vcdii1iga Jyuti,m    The system of the VJ is the same as that 1aught in the Cargasa111hitii of the Sar,ihitii period, being the immediate centuries before Christ and the next following, Paitiimaha Siddhiinta condensed in the PS and the Jain works like Jyotisakaral')(ia and Siiryaprajiiapti. The only difference is that the Paitiimaha gives a rule for the Vyatfpiita-yoga and the Jain works have brought down the winter solstice from Sravi$/hii to Sraval'_la, and included Abhijit (Vega) as closing the 20diac, giving it a small segment at the end. All give the five-year yuga of 1830 days with 62 synodic months in it. Everything else, like the 67 lunar siderea.l periods etc. can follow from these three given items. The Paitiimaha instructs that the nak,mtras and tithis are to be calculated from the days elapsed in the yuga using the- unitary method. The Jain works give the day? and the nak,wtras in a parrn, from which they are to be calculated for the other parvas and days.    The VJ states in detail that in the yuga there arc 5 solar years, 67 lunar sidereal cycles, 1830 days, 1835 sidereal days, 62 synodic months, J860 ti this, 135 solar nak,?atras, 1809 lunar nak$a!ras and 1768 risings of the Moon, all derivable from any three principal elements. It also mentions that there are 10 ayanas and iái,wras and 30 rtus or seasons, and the nak$atras and tithis of these are enumerated, their number being small. But the' other things sought to be given, like the daily nak._mtras and tithis with their ending moments, the hour-angle of the Sun at the ends of the parvas and tithis, the hour-angle of Sravinhii with the /agnas, which are too numerous to be enumerated, have been given by ingenious rules that enable them to be calculated mentally day by day, as we want them. It is these rules that have baffled interpreu:rs, since they are couched in archaic, technical and terse language, and the purpose of each cannot be seen easily and the terms used are not generally defined. The day is divided into 124 bhiigas or parts, so that the ending moments of the parvas and tithis can be given in whole units. The day is again divided into 603 units called kaliis, so that the dura-tion of the lunar nak$afras is given in whole units as 6!0 ka/iis. The nak,mtra is divided into 124 af!1ias so that the nak:jatras passed at the ends of the pan-as may be expressed in whole amSGs. A table of the division of time i? given, beginning from gurvak,mra16	VED.?NGA JYOTl?Aor the double miitrii or long syllable, to the day, passing on to the yuga. The practical way of measuring time is mentioned as the time laken by a specified quantity of water to flow through the orifice of a specified clepsydra, as one nU(likii or 60th part of a day.1. Accuracy of the Vcdiitiga Jyofi$a    We shall now proceed to examine the accuracy of the system, a much discussed affair. The VJ says that there are 1830 civil days in the yuga, in which there are five solar sidereal years and 62 lunar synodic months. This give& 366 days for the year while it is really 365.} days, known in the Vedic period before, as we have seen. Abo, it must have been known, even at that period that 62 synodic months take almost a day more than the 1830 given, because even at the end of one y11ga, tl1e amiivUsyii (new moon) must have been observed to occur on the day next to the 1830th. Observa-tion at the end of the next yuga would have ;.hown this unmistakably, since on the la;.t day of the yuga the Moon would have been observed to be well up in the sky at sunrise, showing the day to be caturdasi or even trayodaii, so that the amiiviisyii would occur one or even two days !ater.10 The prie?ts, whose duty it was to observe the last di?appearance of the old Moon and the first appearance of the new Moon, could never have failed to notice this, for there was priiyaSCita (penalty propitiatory rite?) for transgres?ion eithe1 way (see below, verse 12 and notes thereon).    Then, why this apparently absurd system ? The answer is that it was meant pri-marily to provide a civil calend?r, where convenience of division and ease of calculation is important. The 1830 days period is divisible by 5, giving 366 days for the year. This is divisible by 6, giving 6! days for each rtu (season). The uyana has 183 days. The two intercalary months, over the 60 normal months can come, one at the end of the 5th ayana and the other at the end of the 10th. The difference from actuality is already there, because only the computation of the Mean Moon and the Mean Sun was known, which itself could give an error of more than half a day. So the rules for computing the various items like nak?áatras can give only approximate results. But the religious calendar required correct results, and this civil calendar intended for the day to day life of the people could serve only as a frame-work to guide the religious calendar. Certainly the priests must have framed rules by long observation to get tolerably correct positions, so as to avoid the penalty laid down by the Siistras, as mentioned above. For one thing, a day could have been tacitly added to the yuga after its end, as suggested by many, (even as we do every fourth year to get the leap year), and not counted in the calculation, to make up the 62 synodic months, so that the most patent discrepancy could be avoided. H. Krishna Sastry Godbole, writing about the Vedic calendar in 1884, suggested this. As this would amount to allowing the error to accumulate to one day before correction, some- suggest that the uncounted day might have been placed at the end of the 5th ayana, i.e. after the first intercalary month. Tilak suggests that it was done at the end of the 93rd parva and adds that it is actually instructed by verse 12. I think he is not correct (cf. the verse).l"<TRODUCTION	17    But there is another type of error that will accumulate in course of time. 62 synodic months is exactly 1830á8965 days. So, the correct Mean Sun would be 4'á54 in advance of Sravi$!hii, each yuga. It will accumulate to 30¡ in 30-:.4 54 yugas. To bring the Sun and the Moon back to Sravi$/fuJ, one intercalary month will have to be dropped after 6 yugas and another intercalary month after 7 yugas, and this has to be repeated. The priests could have found this rule by experience and used it. But it must be noted that it is not even necessary to know this rule to drop the intercala-tion, because mere observation of the Moon in the SravisJhii region of the sky would have shown this, for this must have been the rule during the Vedic times (as the Muslims do even today, by ovserving the crescent Moon) to find the need for an inter-calation, for this is independent of the knowledge of the exact periods of cycle,.    But, still, in course of time, the winter solstice itself would move from Sravisthii to ?}rai,a,:1a and so on, at the rate of about one nak,mtra in 1000 years, owing to.ihe precession of the equinoxes, and this correction must be done to know the correct seasons. It has already been mentioned that the Siiryaprajfiapti and other works actually placed the winter solstice at the beginning of SraiáaQ.a. But one thing is certain. Long after the time of Lagadha, the system of the VJ was follo\?ed in India as seen from the Mahiibhiirata, the Artha?'iistra, Gargasaf!lhitii and the Paitiimaha Siddhiinta, first in all parts, and then at least in some parts, for almanac making, and that is why it is described in the PS as one of the ?ystems in vogue, though crude. But by then it had come to be linked with the ]uni-solar year to prevent accumulation of error, as we have already mentioned.8. Modern studifs on Vcdiihga Jyoti!}a    The above discussion would show how wrong and unjustified Whitney was, when he remarked: "The so-called Vedic astronomical manual (VJ) whose first object seemingly ought to be to give rules on such points (as amiivii.1yii etc.) is mostly filled with un-intelligible rubbish, and leaves us in the lurch as regards valuable information." This remark is born of frustration, for, if un-intelligible, how does he decide it is rubbish ?    The VJ attracted the attention of the early Indologists like Sir William Jones and Colebrooke, especially the two verses placing the winter solstice at SraviJfhii, which could help in determining Vedic chronology, Later, Capt, Jervis, who was investigating the Indian measurement of time, noticed it in 1834. Prof. A Weber was the first to bring out an edition of both the recensions of VJ with the different readings from the manuscripts available to him. But excepting for a few simple verses in the First and Second Sections of the edition presented hereinbelow, few could interpret the main body of the verses. It was in 1877 that Thibaut in his article entitled, 'Contri-butions to the explanation of the Jyotisha Vedanga' published in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (47.i.411-37) could decipher a few of the difficult verses, leaving out several verses, including 11, 13-17, 19-23, 25-27 and 41 of the Y-VJ un-touched. His knowledge of astronomy and adequate knowledge of Sanskrit helped18	VED.4,.'.:GA JYOTl?Ato interpret the other venes, in spite of the obscure terms and the apothegmatic language, because the meaning of these could be guessed if what they are driving at is known. Then, in 1884, H. K. Godbole tried to tackle the problem of the correct religious calendar to be got from the approximate civil one. Next, S. B. Dikshit, in his Bharat/ya Jyoli;ja-Siistra in Marathi (Poona, 1896) brought his excellent know-ledge of Hindu astronomy to bear on the VJ and interpreted some more uninterpreted verses. But the more important verses were- left untouched by him. In 1907, Lala Chote Lal, Executive- Engineer, W.P., brought out a full-fledged edition, adopting the p?udonym 'Biirha&pfltya', giving his own interpretation to all the verses, re-printing them from the Hindusthan Review, wherein they had appeared serially, However, in many places his meaning is not clear in spite of his long explanations. Neitl1er has he mentioned what was being done nor has he given examples. At about the same time, M. M. Sudhakara Dvivedi of the Queen's College, Banaras, who had edited the PS in collaboration with G. Thibaut, edited the VJ with an old Sanskrit commentary by Somiikara. in which he noticed many of the interp1etations of 'Biirhaspatya', some of them as conected by him. However his peculiar way of emending the verses drastically has affected this edition. Then again, his presump-tion of the use of bhUtasa/1.khyii is unwarranted. But even where he agreed, he has tried to show off his superior knowledge of Sanskrit by giving his own 'better' interpretation. These exasperated 'Biirhaspatya' to such an extent, that he issued an Appendix criticising Sudhakara Dvivedi right and left. One very good service that 'Biirhaspatya' has done is to append a critic:il edition of the both the rccensions of the VJ, to his e"dition of the work.    The renowned Indian patriot and freedom fighter, B.G. Tilak wrote his 'Notes on the interpretation of the Vediiliga Jyotisha: Criticisms and suggestions' in 1914 while he was lodged in jail in Mandalay, Burma.U He took for criticism Y-VJ 15, 19, 27 (with its variation R-VJ 13), 21, 20, 25, 26, 12, 14 and R-VJ 19. Of these Y-VJ 15, 20, 21, 25 and 26 have been dealt correctly by him, pointing out the defects and mistakes in the interpretations of  'Biirhaspatya' and Sudhakara Dvivedi, but in Y-VJ 19 he committed the simple mistake of taking ud?¥apet to mean 'should be added', instead of 'should be taken away'. By this he missed the meaning of the verse and, to make up for the error in the rule created thus, he had to misinterpret Y?VJ 27 and R-VJ l3 as well as to supplement it. Still, his interpretation is only approximate, as he himself has owned. Thus a perfect rule was spoiled by a small mistake. The involved interpretation, requiring several pages of explanation, should itself have told him that he was going on the wrong track. I disagree with his inter-pretation also of Y-VJ 12 and 14 which he takes as providing for the one day to be left out of count, to correct the system to keep in step with reality. Y-VJ 27 deals with /agna, about the meaning of which he is not sure. In the present edition all these points have been dealt with convincingly.    We have already seen that, at about 1916, Swamikannu Pillai took certain points in the VJ for discussion (vide his Indian Ephemeris, vol. I, pt. i, pp. 443-56:JNTRODUCTION	19'The Vedanga Jyotisha calendar'). In 1936, R. Shamasastry, Retd. Curator, Oriental Library, and Director of the Archaeological Researches in Mysore brought out an edition of the Y-VJ, with his own Sanskrit commentary and English translation and notes. It is not a critical edition and in spite of the good interpretations of scholars before him he has misinterpreted almost all the verses included in the Fifth Section of the present edition. He has quoted from the Jain works, but exhibits ignorance not only of their meaning but also of their purpose. For instam:e, in order to get the pa,va-nak$atras and a,pfas, the number of nak1atras and a,riSas moved in one parva (which is given as a constant) are multiplied by the namber of parvos. This cannot be done mentally and, so Y-VJ 15 and 18 give simple rules to get it. But Shamasastry interprets that the said two verses give the days not fit for dar.fopiir-!Jamiisa sacrifices and, even that, using his own peculiar criterion for the same. As for getting the panáa-nak1atras and a'!7fas, he asks us to add to those of the prcviou'> parva, the motion for one parva, and this too in kaliis, mostly fractional ! His inter-pretation of Y-VJ 13 is a monument for his capacity. And, the most ridiculous as-pect is that he criticises the earlier interpreters, who are by far his superiors. Still later, Dr. Satya Prakash offered a detailed treatment of the topics dealt with in the VJ in the chapter l!ntitled 'Lagadha: The first to rationalize astronomy' in his book Founders of Sciences in Ancient India, (New Delhi, 1965, pp. 455-512), but he takes his translations verbatim from Shamasastry and in the explanations also follows him which makes his treatment liable to the severe limitations of his source-book.8. Ackno.,.;/edgements    I have the satisfaction now that what I began in 1960 and worked off and on has been duly brought to a completion. I think of all those who have helped me in the publication of this edition, especially to the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Bombay who provided a forum for my expounding the subject in detail in the Workshop on Ancient insights and modern discoveries organised by them. My thanks are due to every one who has devoted his attention to the VJ, irrespective of whether he has done well or ill, for I have benefitted from his work in some way or other. I cherish with gratitude the memory of my two friends who enthused me in the work, first the Vedic and Vedanta scholar, Malma Narashimachariar, a respected precrptor of the Munitrayam Sect, who learnt the Silryasiddhiinta and the Yiiju,sa-Vediiilga lyotifa from me, and second, Srinivasa Iyengar of Periakulam, Retired Head Master, a Viijasaneyin and a man of many parts with a furid of knowledge who discussed many problems with me and gave me his copy of Tilak's paper on the subject.T.

But these sacrifices are dependent on the (various segments of) time. Therefore, only he who knows the lore of time, viz. Jyoti$a, understands the performance of the sacrifices (fully).

The word tOb here refers to the four piidas given in the thlrd foot of the verse as catu?piidf, being a compound of catun;iim piidiiniim samiihiirab. The word piida itself means the number 3t by the statement, piidas tritJ1Sat tu saikikii (Y-VJ 12b). The word pada in this verse also signifies 31.    Note 2. The reason for adopting the above-said significance is that the day is divided into 124 bhiigas or parts. Since a quarter (pOda) of this is 31, the word piida is used to signify the number 31. Similarly, the asterismal segment also is divided into 124 parts called at11fas or bhiimias.Text 9kii,?{hii paiiciikJarii bhavet/ Y-VJ 39dOne kii${hii i? equal to five ak,?aras (letters of double miitriis).

Yuga means 'joining or coming together', technically the coming together of two or more of the Sun, the Moon, the star-planets, their nodes and the apogees, at the same place in the zodiacal circle marked by the asterisms. The five-year yuga mentioned here is the period when the Sun and the Moon meet in the same nsterismal position in the zodiac, discovered in the Vedic period itself, and which is roughly correct. The Vedas have a name for each of the years of this yuga: Sa111vatsarab, Parivatsara!J, /dii(cjci)vatsarab, Anuvatsara!J, Jd(Ud)vatsara{1 (Viij. Sam. 27.25), with some variants in certain places.1.

The people learned in the religious lores say that these deity-names are to be substituted for their own names in the (sarikalpa of) the yiiga (of the person on whose behalf the sacrifice is performed, viz.) the yajamiina. (R-VJ 25-28; Y-VJ32-35)    Note I. While naming a child, it was the custom in ancient times to choose a name the first letter of which is appropriate to the astcrism under which the child was born. A set of letters is associated with the asterisms. Even now, conversely, when a person's nakJatra is not known, he is given a nak$afra appropriate to the first letter of his name, for religious rites or horary predictions. In ordinary religious rites, it is declared in the introductory resolution (saiikalpa): 'I, bearing this. name and born under this asterism, am going to perform this rite.' But when he happens to be the yajanulna in a yiiga, in the place of his own name and asterism, the aeity of the asteri?m is to be substituted, the idea being that he is now one with the deity and the deity itself is performing the yiiga, as, say, 'Ajaekapad yajate', meaning, 'Ajaekapad per-forms this yiiga.'Text 13ugrll{IJ' llrdrii ca dtrii ca v1Siikhii Sfavaf}o '.frayuk/kriiriif}i tu maghii sviiti }J('$/hii millat11 yamasya yat// Y-VJ 36The asterisms Ardrii, Citrii, Vifrlkhii, Sramf}a and A.frini are fierce.

These are mentioned here as an exception to the previous verse, and the names of the deities of these should not be used for the purpose mentioned. Further, these should be avoided in choosing the time for the performance of auspicious rites like marriage.Note 2. The R-VJ does not have this verse.1.

This rule of three is to be applied again and again to the day, (using the fundamental and derived constants given in the work, in order to get the various computa-tional rules and results given in the work).

The four items are: (a) If for so much quantity, (b) so much result is got, (c) for this much quantity given now, (d) how much is the result that will be got? The first two arc calledjfiiita-rii¤is and the next two are called jrleya-riiSis. The application of the rule is: Take the known result, i.e. (b), multiply it by the quantity (c) for which the result is to be known, and divide by the quantity (a) for which the result is given; thus the result to be known, i.e. (d), is got.

The present section continues from verse Y-VJ 28, given in the previous Section II, Text J 1, and its meaning should be understood here, viz. the 366 days form the year and that in the year, there are 6 rtus, 2 ayanas and 12 solar months. Five years make the yuga.The number of risings of the asterism Sravi$fhti in the yuga is the number of daysp/us five (i.e. 1830+5=1835). The number of risings of the Moon is the days minus 62 (i.e. 1830-62=d768). The total of each of the Moon's 27 asterisms coming round 67 times in the yuga is the number of the days minus 21 (i.e. 1830-21=1809). (Y-VJ 29)In the s.ame way, the total of the asterisms of the Sun (which comes round 5 times) is 135. There are one less (i.e. 134) ayanas of the Moon (i.e. its north-ward and southward courses). There are 4 piidas (i.e. 4x31=124) parras (or pak$aS, or their ends. i.e. bright and dark fortnights) in the yuga   (Y-VJ30 a-c)42	VEDA.NGA JYOTij;AThere are 60+ l, 2, 7 (i.e. 61, 62 and 67) siivana months, lunar (synodic) months, and Moon's sidereal months (cycles), respectively, in the yuga. Again, the savana month contains 30 days. This plus half (i.e. 30?) days make the solar month. The number mentioned here (viz. 30) is the number of solar sidereal cycles in the yuga. (Y-VJ 31)The Moon comes into contact with each asterism 60+ 7 (i.e. 67) times during the yuga. The Sun stays in each asterism I3 days plus 5/9 day. (R-VJ 18 a-c; Y-VJ39 a-c).    Note 2. Any three elements of the yuga, pertaining to the Sun and Moon, not totally dependent on one another, if given, will enable m, to calculate every other thing mentioned here, which latter might be called derived constants with reference to the three fundamentals. For instance, three are in the yugo, (i) 5 years, (ii) l 830 days and (iii) 62 synodic lunar months. With a little knowledge of astronomy and knowing the definitions, we can compute the others thus:a. Sidereal risings (i.e. sidereal days)=solar risings (i.e. ordinary days) plus solar cycles (i.e. solar years)=l830+5=1835 (given in the text as risings of Sravi$(hii).b. Lunar cycles=Synodic months plus solar years =62+5=67 (as given in the text).c. Moon's risings=Risings of Sravi?fhti (or any other star) minus Moon's cycles=1835-67=1768, as given in the text. The other given numbers can be obtained from these by division or multiplication.    Note 3. Though the Moon's oyanos are not commonly spoken of, it must also have northward and southward courses, during each sidereal cycle, since its orbit also, roughly following the ecliptic, must cross the celestial equator northward and southward.Note 4. Since there are 2 pak$as (parvas) in each synodic month, there are 62x 2= 124 pok1as in the yugo. It is this that has necessitated the division of the day into 124 parts, in order to give whole number results as far as possible.Note 5. The reading navamtini of R-VJ 18 has been adopted in the place ofuttamiini of Y-VJ 39, the latter being not suitable to the context.2. LAGNAS IN THE 'YUGAText 16Srovi$/hiibhyo gu(?ga?.,iibhyastiit priigvilagrnin vinirdiJetf sii(_?sta)ryiin miisiin 1a!abhyastiin vidyiit ciindramasiin rtWI/J R-VJ 19Ill. YUGA CONSTANTS	43Using the risings of Srav(?Jhii in the yuga (viz. 1835), which are also the number of its Ori1mt Ecliptic points (priig-lagna), and multiplying it by the number in the group (here, of asterisms, viz. 27), we get the total number of lagnas in the yuga (viz. 1835x 27.c. e49,545). Multiplying the sidereal revolutions of the Moonin the yuga by 6, we get the total number of lunar rtus (viz. 67 X 6=402). [Considering the mandatory verb in the first half of the verse, one can translate it also as: Using the distance of Sravi$Jha from the rising point (i.e. its hour angle), and multiplying it by 27, we get the lagna, in asterisms and parts).] (R-VJ 19).    Note 1. In the yuga, the Sun makes five rounds forwards in the zodiac, which itself is rotating rapidly backwards round the earth. Since the time of the motion of the Sun relative to the earth is the civil day, and there are 1830 civil days in the yuga, the zodiac itself rotates round the earth 1835 (1830+5), times in the yuga, the time of one rotation being called a sidereal day.    Note 2. A single or a group of asterisms of asterismal segments, being fixed in the zodiac, makes the same number ofrotations.Lagna, as usually used, is the point of the ecliptic rising on the eastern horizon. Sometimes the wordpriig-lagna is used to distin-guish it from the Occident (West) Ecliptic point and Meridian Ecliptic point (daiama-lagna). Now-a-days lagna is mentioned only in connection with the riisis. In those days there was no division into rOSis, but there was the division of the zodiac into naksatra segments. We do not know whether the lagna, in those days, was of the asterisms themselves or the asterismal segments. The exact time of the rising of any point can be calculated from its distance from the diurnal circle, the whole mw:u/ala representing 603 kaliis or 124 parts of time. (See also Section V. 4, below).    Note 3. In the text the syllable gu has been emended into ga, making gw;ia into ga?a by me. Dikshit has taken gw:,o to mean 3, according to the bhUtasafikhyii notation, but this notation does not seem to have been in vogue at such an early period. In the whole of the work we do not find it used anywhere else. But BO:rhaspatya commits a worse mistake by interpreting gu?a as 8 in the bhutasaitkhyii, which tram>gresses all conventions. This kind of transgression will result in ambiguity, while the requirement is that the numbers are precise.    Note 4. The Sun or Moon's ayanas is spoken of as beginning from their situation at the first point of the Sravi?thii segment or midpoint of the A.Sle?a segment, respec-tively (See Y-VJ 7 in Section IV.2, below). The ayanas have 3 rtus each. The sidereal period containing 2 ayanas have 6 rtus. In the yuga,'having 67 sidereal periods of the Moon, the rtus are 67x 6=402. It is noted that while the names of the rtus SiSira, Vas.anta etc. beginning with the Sun at SraviHha are significant as referring to real seasons, in the case of the Moon, they are simply nominal.    Note 5. I have emended sU into sta, making it staryiin which means 'pertaining to the stars (str)', much like the Vedic word narya, since the word starya is an uncommon44	VED.\?GA JYOTl?Aword, it is easily mistaken to be siirya in the copying of manuscripts.

The night decreases at the same rate and vice versa during the southward course. During the whole course (ayana) the increase or decrease amounts of 6 muhiirtas{=12 niiefiktis) (R-VJ 7; Y-VJ 8).    Note 1. The time when the courses begin and end is given in the next Section. From the given data the duration of the course can be calculated to be 183 days, and the increase per day, which is given as one prastha, can be calculated from the data in the previous Section to be 4/61 nii{likti. For the whole course of 183 days, the increase is 183x4/61=12 nti{jikiis or 6 muhilrtas.    Note 2. The rate of increase given here is the average per day. It is very crude. Actually, for the first and sixth months of the course it is approximately a sixth of the total. for the second and fifth it is a third, and for the third and fourth it is half.    Note 3. The total increase is not the same in all latitudes. It is proportionate to tan declination >". tan latitude. The latitude corresponding to the total given here is 350, in the extreme north of India. The Viisi$fha Siddhiinta of the Paiicasiddhiintikii of Variihamihira gives the same total increase, not to speak of the crude Paitiimaha Siddhiinta.SECTION IVTlTHI, NAK?ATRA ETC.

(R-VJ S; Y-VJ 6).When situated at the beginning of the Sra1ái$!hii segment, the Sun and the Moon begin to move north. When they reach the midpoint of the A.Sle$U segment, they begin moving south. In the case of the Sun, this happens always in the month of Magha and Sravai:ia. respectively. (R-VJ 6; Y-VJ 7)     ,Vote 1. The VJ system has simplified the various periods as the 5 sidereal revolu-tions of the Sun in the y11ga of 1830 days, 67 sidereal revolutions of the Moon in the same period, etc. This is done for civil calendrical purposes, which demand such:,imp!ification, just as, in modern times, the year is taken by us now to have 365 days, ordinarily, with one day more once in four years, calling it leap year, with its own further exceptions. This serves only as a framework for a religious clalendar. So, the yuga cannot begin exactly at the first point of Sravi?tha segment generally, unless corrected. Further, the given cycle-days are mean, while the actual courses depend upon the true Sun and Moon, affected by the equations of the centre. So, only the region marked by the asterism Sravi$/hii. can be specified. The exact points of the segments where the courses begin were determined by simple calculations based on inspection of the sky. For details see Introduction. The words adau and ardhe in Y-VJ 7 signify that the exact point of the segments are meant, of course, for the civil calendar.    Note 2. Prapadyete here means 'move', not simply 'reach' and ayanam means 'movement', primarily. The secondary meaning is 'the period of movement'. Only the Sun's ayanam is popularly used.46	VEDA.Iii.GA JYOTl?A    Note 3. The beginning of the northward movement of the Sun at Sravi$fhii and the mention of the day-time to be least here (see Sn. IJI.3, Y-VJ 8) shows that th.is is the time of the winter solstice. From this, the time when the original work of Lagadha was written can be determined. (See Introduction).    Note 4. There is a corrupt reading dinam tya)ab for ayanam hyudak. This is made much of by some. (See Introduction).2.

The interval between the vi$u1¥as is 124/10 pan-as= 12 pan¥as and 6 tithis. So, the time gone at the nth viwva=(n-?) (12P 61)=(211-l) (6P 3t)=(2n-l)x6 pamis and half that of tithis.    Note 2. There is no verse in either R-VJ or Y-VJ giving the nak?atra of these points.    Note 3. R-VJ means the same as Y-VJ 23. Also R-VJ is only an enumeration of the result of R-VJ 31.    Note 4. trayodaSO, meaning the 13th tithi, inR-VJ 33 is wrong, and seems to have found a place here by correspondence to the word trayodaiam in R-VJ 8. In that verse it is proper since the beginning tithis are given for the ayana points. But here the ends of the tithis are given and there is driidaSim, which is correct. driidaSyiim in the latter half of the verse is to be emended to dviidaSi"m, to fall in line with the other adverbial accusatives.1. trus IN A YUGAText 22ek<intare '/mi miise capUrviim krtvii "dir(?m) uttarab/ardhayob paiicavar$01J.iim mrd11 (?rdu) paficadasii${ame// Y-VJ 11ln each of the the two halves of the five-year-yuga, in the alternating periods or one synodic month and tithi, the next rtu occurs after the previous one, (in other words, the consecutive rtus occur at intervals of two synodic months and48	VEDA.NGA rrom:Atwo tithis because 30 rtus make up 62 synodic months). Regarding the eighthrtu, the 15th tithi comes as the beginning tithi. (Y-VJ 11).    Note 1. The first rtu of the yuga is Sisira, as can be seen from the statement that the first rtu month is Tapas (vide R-VJ 7; Y-VJ 6), Tapas and Tapasya being the months of Sisira (cf. Tapai ca Tapasyai ca Saisiriiv rtii, Vii). Sa1rr. 13.25; Taitt. Saflz. 4.4.11.1). The next rtu Vasanta begins two synodic months and two tithis later, i.e. on Caitra-Sukla TrtfyU, Siiira having begun in the Miigha-Suk!a Prathamii. This continues for the rest.    Note 2. The 15th tithi mentioned as the beginning of the 8th rtu is PUn;inul. I have emended mrdu as rdu and have taken it to mean a contraction for rtu-dyu.1. PART OF THE DAY AT WHICH PARVA ENDSText 23du (?dyu) heya,rr parva cet pGde ....bhagGtmanii 'pavrJyiifflSiin nirdiied adhiko yadi/,1Y-VJ l2 a,c-dIf the end of the syzygy occurs within the first poda (i.e. 31 parts of the day), that tithi is to be omitted from the reckoning. If the parts are more than 31, the parva whose tithi is to be omitted is to be found by subtracting the number of parts that has to be lessened for the elapsing of one parva each. ( Y-VJ 12 a, c-d)    Note 1. 31 parts is a quarter of the day which is divided into 124 parts. So, less than 31 parts means 'before mid-day'.    Note 2. Even today, the syzygy falling before or after mid-day is crucial in decid-ing the day for the performance of it/i, though the tithi is taken now as true tithi.    Note 3. The parts of the day, at which. the end of each successive parva occurs, is 30 parts less and less each pan-a, since the duration of each parva= days in the yuga divided by 124=15 days minus 30 parts. This means 2 parts less for each tithi.    Note 4. The verse, however, takes for granted that the parts of the day at which the parva ends is known, for then alone can we know in which piida of the day the parva-end falls. This can be learnt only by imp!ication from the second half of this verse, since nowhere else in the work has it been given. We can proceed taking the successive 15-day periods in the yuga, subtracting 30 parts for each, to get the end of the successive parvas. This is given in the verse. But this is the same as taking the parva number and subtracting 31 parts, or one piida, for each parva. Since we want only the parts, and can neglect whole days accumulated, and, since 4 piidas make a fullIV. TITID, NAK$AIRA ETC.	49day, we can cast out fours, take the remainder and subtract one, two or three piidas for the remainders J, 2 or 3. Or, which is the same, we can add 3 piidar or 94 parts, add 2 plldas or 62 parts, or add one pada or 31 parts to the number of the parvas for the remainders l, 2, 3 respectively, interpreting bhiigiitmana to mean piida-bhii.giitmana. Thus we get the simple ru!e implied by the second ha!fofthe verse: Take the ordinal number of the parva. Cast out fours and get the remainder. If 1 remains, add 93; if 2 remains, add 62; and if 3 remains, add 31. If there is no remainder, take the number alone. We get the parts at which the parva ends.Example. Find the parts of the day ending: (i) 37, (ii) 43, (iii) 54 and (iv) 68 parvas.    i. Casting out fours from 37, I remains. So, 93+37-;- 124=130/124=6 (module 124). So, 6 is the number of parts of the day at which the 37thparva ends. Verification: 37x 18307124=546 6/124 days and the 37thparva ends.    i. Casting out fours from 43, remainder is 3. So, 43+31=74 is the number of parts ending 43 parvas. Verification: 43 x 18307124=634 74/124, which gives 74 parts, neglecting full days.    i. Casting out fours from 54, 2 remains. So, 62+54=116 parts at the end of 54 parvas. Verification: 54x 18307124=796 I 16/124 days, which gives l 16 parts, neglecting full days.    i. Casting out fours from 68, 7..ero remains. So, 68 itself is the number of parts of the day at the end of the 68th pan¥a. Verification: 68 X 1830--;- ]24=1003 68/124, which gives 68 parts at the end of 68 parvas, neglecting full days.    Note 5. For the sake of convenience, the civil calendar requires the reckoning of days from 1 to 15, consecutively, taking the synodic month to contain 29 or 30 full days. By taking or omitting the day for #!i according to this ru!e, the i?/i day can be made to be always on the first day of the fortnight, and the jump at any day of the fortnight owing to tithi-k?aya or avama can be avoided. The subsequent fortnight when this tithi-kJaya will fall, can also be determined.    Note 6. The f!gi¥edic recension does not have this verse, but the number of parts at parva-ending is required for R-VJ 20 and 13.    Note 7. Tilak correctly notes that if the civil calendar is to keep sufficiently near the religious calendar, a day has to be omitted for each yuga, without being counted in it. He thinks that this verse actually gives this by the words dyu heyam. But, where is the day to omit? Like the interc.alary month, the day must he mentioned first as an extra day of the yuga, and then it should be said that it be omitted for reckoning the nak$alra, tithi etc. and their characteristics. Otherwise dyu heyam cannot mean what he says. For his explanation that the 93rd pana day was so omitted, he says50	VEDAkGA  JYOTJ?Athat the Moon's nakfatra parts at the pana is 31. This is wrong. On the other hand, it is 93. Hence the meaning of the verse must be quite different. (See my interpretation here and the explanation in note 5 above.) Mistakes have also been made by 'Barhaspatya' and Sudhakara Dvivedi in their interpretations.1. CURRENT YEAR OF THE YUGAText 24ye brhaspatinii blmktiil; miniit prabhrti rii.fayab/tril'rtii.b (?te hrtiib) paiicabhir r (? bhU) ta ya¤ se?as sa parigrahat,(Y-VJ, un-numbered verse after 4)Count the riiSi (30¡ sign division of the zodiac) in which Jupiter is situated from the riiii cal!ed Mina (Pisces). Divide the number by five and take the 1emainder. This is to be taken as the number of the year current in the five-year yuga. (Y-VJ, Un-numbered verse after 4).    Note I. The five years are named, respectively, as stated earlier, Sa,rrvatsara, Parivatsara, f4iivatsara, Anuvatsara and Id (Ud)varsara. As any day of the Vediiriga calendar is specified as this day, of this fortnight, of this month, of this year, the ordinal number of the year is also required to specify the day. R-VJ 4: Y-VJ 13 under Sn. V. 1, below, will illustrate its use.    Note 2. This verse is patently an interpolation. Firstly it is un-numbered and found only in the Yiiju,w recension. Secondly, the word rii.fi itself, meamng the division of the zodiac of 30¡ each, named Me,rn (Aries), ?ahha (Taurus) to Mina (Pisces), is of foreign origin and came into India only during the first centuries A.O. along with Greek astrology. Upto and including the time of the early astronomical sa,rrhitiis of the last centuries 13.C., the only zodiacal divisions known in India were the nak$alra divisions. Rii.fi as used in the VJ means only 'group', for example 'parva-riisi', meaning the 'group of fortnights' and 'bha-rii.fi', meaning the 'group of nak$afra segments'.    Note 3. This verse serves a useful purpose and that is why it has been interpolated. The calendric system of the VJ is purposely made approximate, in order to serve as a good civil calendar and serve simply as a framework for the religious calendar. In course of time, the error from the correct synodic cycle or solar sidereal year will accu? mulate and the calendar, on account of wandering farther and farther away from the truth, will not serve as a framework for the religious calendar. This happens so rapidly that even within a few yugas it would become useless, if it is not linked to actual ob? servation by periodic corrections, in the same way as the purely lunar calendar of the Muslims is corrected by the observation of the first appearance of the crescent Moon. But unless connected with the solar year, the Muslim months will recur earlier and earlier so that there is an excess of three years in a century. The Hindu lunar calendarV. DAILY TITH!, NAK?ATRA ETC.	51is linked with the solar year by intercalary months (adhimasas) so that it does wander away. Now, the omission of an adhimisa at intervals indicated by observation in the sky, will link the erroneous civil VJ calendar with the actual calendar. But, in course of time, less dependance on observation and more on calculation came into practice. Here it is linked with the correct Jovian year. As discussed in the Introduction, Var.ii.-hamihira, linked the rough Pa.itamaha Siddhiinta of the Paficasiddhiintikii with the Saka yea?.SECTION VDAILY TITH!, NAK?ATRA ETC.1. INTRODUCTORY    In Section IV calendric details like tithi and nak?atra of certain specific days, for example, the beginning of the ayana, were given as already calculated, because they are small in number. Even for the rtus, which are thirty in number, these details were given by a rule for calculation, though very simple. But there are 124 parvas and 1860 tithis. Details like their ending moments cannot be given readymade, because they are so numerous. This calculation has to be done in each case and involves large numbers. To accomplish this mentally, ingenious rules are given in this Section. Scholars who tried to interpret the VJ did not even guess that this is what is done here, and so failed, some to a greater degree and some to a smaller degree, baffled by the obscurity of the terms used, for, as the saying goes, vQkyirthajiiiine tiitparyajiiinamapi karaT)am.1.

Lessen this by I, multiply by 12, again multiply by 2, add the parvas gone in the year, for every 60 of the total parvas add 2, and the number obtained is the parva-riiii (i.e. the total number of parvas gone at the time for which calculations are to be made). (By repeating the word, we can also interpret it as: Multiply the years gone by 12, add the months gone, double what is obtained, add the parvas gone, if any, etc.) (R-V/4; Y-V/13)    Example. Find the parva-raii before the point of time indicated by Anuvatsara, Ktirttika Ba!UJ!a Navami.52	VEDANGA JYOTl?AAnuvatsara is the fourth year of the yuga. So, 3 years, 9 months and one parva(.iulda) are gone. From this:Parva-rriSi=(3x 12+9) 2+1+2 (for 60 parvas gone)=93    Note 1. In each year there are 12 synodic months, each month having 2 parvas. After 30 months, an extra (adhika) or interca!ary month is added to complete the half yuga. This is why the two parvas are added. Thus, we get the total, there being 62 synodic months or 124 parvas in the yuga.1. ASIERISMAL PARTSText 26syu(i piido 'rdham tripiidyii yii tridvyeke 'hnab krte(?ta) sthitim/samyenendob str( ?stvr)-!lo 'nye tu parvaka[, pancasammitiibf !Y-VJ 14On account of the civil days of the yuga being divided into quarters, halves and three quarters corresponding to the divisibility of the Moon's asterisms in the yuga, the Moon's asterismal parts also are a quarter (i.e. 31 parts), two quarters (i.e. 62 parts), three quarters (i.e. 93 parts) and without residue. But the other parts of the asterisms have to be measured in units of fifth divisions of the parts. (Y-VJ 14)    Note I. This is what is said in this v.erse: The number of civil days in the yuga, containing 124 parvas, being 1830, at a quarter (i.e. 31) oftheparvas the days gone are 457 and 62 parts. The Moon's asterisms gone are 1809--:-4=452 and 31 parts. At half (i.e. 62) of the parvas, fhe days gone are 915 and the asterisms gone are 904 and 62 parts. At three quarters (i.e. 93) of the parvas, the days gone are 1372 and 62 parts and the asterisms gone are 1356 and 93 parts. In these cases, where the day-parts are full quarters, the asterismal parts are also full quarters. But at al! other parvas, the day-parts being naturally full, (since the division of the day into 124 parts are expressed for this purpose), the asterismal parts cannot be full. So another division of the day called kalas, into 603 parts, is required to express the times of the beginnings of the asterisms. In this unit, the asterism takes exactly 6JO to pass. It is five times the number of parts taken by the tithi to pass and we have 122x 5=610.    This simple statement of fact has made the verse difficult to understand, because it is worded in obscure terms. The difficulty in understanding has naturally led to corruptions in the readings, adding to the difficulty. It is also to be noted that mandates giving the purpose are comparatively easier to understand than statements, because knowing the purpose it is easy to guess the method given to achieve the purpose from the given data.V. DAILY TJTHI, NAK?ATRA ETC.	53    Note 2. On account of the difficulty, 'Biirhaspatya' makes all sorts of emenda-tions. He arbitrarily divides the pratipad into 8 parts, not known to the yiij;fikas, adding some to the new moontithi and some to thepratipad, for which he has been criti-cized by Tilak. Sudhakara Dvivedi has done worse, in his usual manner, making drastic emendations. Tilak himself relates the verse to the intercalary day mooted by him. (cf. Introduction).1. BHA?1SAS OR NAK?ATRA-PARTSText 27bhii111Scib syur atfakiil; kiiryii(I paktadviidasdkodgatiiMekadaiagu?iai conab .iuk!e 'rdham caindavii yadi//R-VJ JO; Y-VJ 15Eight nak$alra-parts (bhii1riias) are to be put down for every unit in the quotient of the number of parvas divided by 12. The remainder is to be multiplied by 11 and added. If the parYa in question is full moon, 62 parts more are to be added if the parts refer to the Moon's nak$afra (and not the Sun's). (R-VJ JO; Y-VJ 15)    Note I. The nak$atra-parts mentioned here are 124th parts. The parts are intended to be used in verses R-VJ 14-15: Y-VJ 17-18, to find the nak1atra of which these are the parts. This is the point of the nakJatra of the Sun and Moon at the end of the new moon, and of the Sun at the fu!I moonparva, without the 62 added, and of the Moon with the 62 added.Example. Find the nak$atra-part of the Sun and the Moon at the end of the 93rdparva.Working as per instructions in the verse:93-:-12=7 quotient, 9 remainder. 7x8+9x 11=155=3I, casting out 124.This gives the Sun's nak$atra?part. Since the parva ends a bright fortnight, that is, itis a full moon, the Moon's nak$afra-parts are got by adding 62, i.e. they are 93.At the end of the previous, i.e. 92nd pana, which is new moon, the nakJatra-parts of both the Sun and the Moon are: 7x 8+8x 11= 144=20, casting out 124.Note 2. The proof of the rule is as follows: In the yuga, containing 124 parvas,the Sun traverses 5x 27=135 nak$afra segments. During each parva, it traverses 1357124= l+11/124 nalqatra segments. Taking the parts alone, this is 11 of the 124thparts. At the end of 12parvas, it is 12x(I+l l/l24)= 13 8/124. Taking the parts alone, this gives 8. So, for every 12 parvas, it accumulates by 8. For the remainder, the parts54	VEDA.NGA JYOTI?Aare 11 for each, and so the remainder is multiplied by 11 and added. At new moon, the Moon is with the Sun and the parts are the same. But at full moon, the Moon is opposite the Sun, that is, 13? segments or 13 nakiatras and 62 parts away. So we add 62 parts for the Moon.    Note 3. ardham here means 'half (of 124 parts)', i.e. 62 parts, that being the number of parts in half day. Again, pii.da being 3I parts or the first quarter of the day, ardham can mean the first half of the day also.    Note 4. 'Biirhaspatya' has not understood the second half of the verse. He writes: "Should the twelve half¥rnonths be co¥terminous with a complete lunar month, the Moon is half nak$atra and 11 afflias behind the full moon, syzygy." How can the group of 12 half¥months or 6 complete lunar months be at full moon, syzygy? He has missed the meaning of the word Unab and thereby the meaning and purpose of the whole verse. Sudhakara Dvivedi has, as usual, done drastic emendations, and missed the meaning of part of the verse. Tilak well understands the meaning and purpose of the verse.1.

Each of the remainder should be multiplied by 7 and added. If the quotient is odd, add half, (that is 62 parts). If the Moon is setting when the Sun rises, (i.e. if full moon porva), add another half (i.e. 62 parts). (Y-VJ 16).    Note I. Paulastya (or Paurastya) iS an old name for the Moon. The sum of the hour angle-parts of the Sun and those of Sravinha at the end of the parva is given here. Since the hour angle of the Sun is already known, we can know the hour angle of Sravinhii by subtracting the Sun's parts from this. As the hour ang!e-parts of Sravi1Jhii gives the rising point of the zodiac, the asterism's rising point can be got by multiplying it by 27 and dividing by 124. This is the Lagna (Orient ecliptic point) in terms of the nak$alra and its parts and envisaged in R-VJ 19 in Sn. III. 2 above. There the number of stellar lagnas was only apparently given. Here we get the method to find it.    Example. What is the hour angle of Sravi$fhii and the lagna at the end of the 93rd parva?V. DAILY TITID, NAK¤AlltA ETC.	55    The Sun's hour angle, already found, is 62, the parts of the day gone being the hour angle (cf. Y-VJ 14, Note 1 in Sn. V. 3 ahove). The sum to be got by this verse is found thus:On dividing 93 by 9, the quotient is 10 and the remainder 3. 1 x 10+3 X 7+62 (for full moon)=93. This is the sum.Subtracting the Sun's hour angle, 93-62=31, is the hour angle of Sravisfhti. 31 x27+124=6? asterisms counted from Srav1)fhii, i.e. 93 parts of Blraraf).i, is the rising point, Jagna.After the 15th tithi of any parva, (i.e. at the end of any parva), the total. of the bhaiesa (rnentioned in the previous verse, R-VJ 12) is to be got in the following manner: For every quotient of division of the number ofparvas hy 9, one diurnal part is to be taken. For each remainder, two parts less than 9 (i.e. 7) parts are to be taken. (R-VJ 13)    Note 2. It may be seen that R-VJ 13 is parallel to Y-VJ 16 and that its meaning is the same as that of the first half of the latter.    Note 3. Since after every 3 tithis, the diurnal parts are 6 less, and the part of the rise of SravisfhO. itself is one part more, the hour angle of Sravitfhii after the end of every 3 tithis is 5 parts less, and so at the end of a parva it is 25 diurnal parts Jess. From this, the diurnal parts of Sravi1fhri can be got directly for the end of parvas and added. For ease of computation, we can make it I part less for every 5 parvas, since 5 X(-25)= -125=1 (mod. 124).    Note 4. Without using this verse, the hour angle of Sravi$fhii can be got by adding the zodiacal position of the Sun and the diurnal part (hour angle of the Sun) at parva. In this verse, the result of adding the diurnal parts to the hour angle of Sravii{hri is given. So, if n is the number of the parvas, the result got in the verse=Sn+2 diurnal parts.n/124x5x 124=5n, being the zodiacal position of the Sun5n+2x94n=5n+64n (mod. 124)=5n+2n+62n=7n (if n is even) or 7n+62n (if n is odd, i.e. full moon, when the Moon is opposite the Sun).Now, 7n=nx 63/9=63 (q+r/9), where q is the quotient and r the remainder of n/9).=63q+7r=(62+1) q+ 7r=62q+q+ 7r=q+ 7r (if q is even) and 62+q+7r (if q is odd)    Thus we have the total result given by the verse, q+ 7r, ( +62 if q is odd, 62 more if n is odd or full moon).56	VIDA.NGA JYOTI?A    Note 5. 'Barhaspatya' has not translated the third quarter of Y-VJ 16, not understanding what it means. This has landed him in difficulties and he gets out by assuming that the hour angles are not counted from the eastern horizon, as is natural, but are counted separately for each part of the diurnal cirle, viz. the eastern horizon, the meridian, the western horizon and the nadir meridian. Tilak has condemned this as baseless.1.

In the Javiidi arrangement of na/qatras enumerated here, they have been arranged from Aivini, each being the sixth from the previous and represented by means ofindicatory symbols formed by syllables taken from their names or their deities.   Example. At the end of the 93rd parva, what is the nak.falra of the Sun and of the Moon, and also show how many parts of each have gone by.    From the previous example, the Sun's parts at the end of 93 pan-as are 31 and the Moon's 93. So the Sun's nak.fatra is 31 (mod 27), i.e. the 4th nak,atra in theJiiviidi series, viz. Viiiikhii at parts 31. The Moou's nak.falra is 93 (mod 27)=12 giving Bhar(l]Ji at parts 93. Note that the Sun and Moon are l3}nak$atras from each other.    The answers can be verified directly thus: For the 124 parvas of the yuga, the Sun traverses 135 nak.falra segments. FOr 93 J)llrvas, it traverses 93x 135	124=101and 31/124 which (mod 27) is 20 and 31/124, i.e. 31 parts in the twentyfirst nak.fa/ra,i.e. ViSiikhii, reckoned from the first, viz. Sravi1fhii.    Note 2. The R-VJrecension has the reading uttare in the place ofuttariib, which gives better grammatical agreement. The last quarter of this recension, the corrupt kii$/hiiniim devinii ka!iil;, has strayed here from elsewhere. The words dyuhhagebhyo 'dhiko yadi is essential to complete the expression bhiidiinam syiic caturdaiyiim.    Example. The number of the Moon's nak$atra-parts is 93 at the end of the 93rd parva,falling at 62 parts of the day. Does the beginning of the nakJatrafall in the 15th or 14th tithi?    The Moon's nak$atra-parts being greater than 62, the beginning of the nak$atra falls in the Caturdaii tithi. This is got by contrast from the given rule. Positively, the Moon's nak1Qtra-parts, 93, being greater than the day-parts, 62, the beginning falls in the Caturda_fi day. that is, the previous day.    Explanation. Since the nak.fatra takes 7 kaliis longer than the day to pass, the nakJatra-part takes longer than a day-part to pass. So, if the nak$atra at parva is greater than the day-parts, more time than the day-parts would have been taken by the nak$atra-parts to pass. Therefore, the nak$a!ra must have begun earlier than the civil day. How much earlier is given by the verse R-VJ ll: Y-VJ 19, below. (Sn. V. 7).    As for the first rule, referring to the tithi proper, half the nak,wtra-parts, i.e. 62, takes certainly less time than one tithi, which takes 122 parts to pass. So the nak,atra must have begun right within the parva-tithi, that is, the t5th tithi itself, either on that civil day itself, or on the previous civil day.58	VEDA.NGA JYOTI?A    Note 3. From the explanation given above, it will be seen that the two rules are not redundant: one refers to the tithi proper and the other to the civil day marked by the tithi. For example, if at pania end the nak9atra-parts are 44 and the day-parts are 4, the beginning falls in the 15th tithi itself but on the previous day. If the nak1atra-parts are 22 and day-parts 64, the beginning falls in the 15th tithi on the same civil day.1. KALAS FOR MOON'S NAK?ATRAText 30karyii bharriiiiffakastlwne kahi ekiiMavirpJatibfiinasthiine dvi(?tri)saptatim udvaped Wlasambhave/JR-VJ 11; Y-VJ 19R-VJ has a better reading for the last quarter: saptatir udvaped iinasammitiil:,.For every 8 nak1atra-parts, 19 kaliis are to be set down for work. For the less (i.e. the remainder), when the remainder occurs, take away 73 kaliis for each of the number remaining. (This meaning is clearer in the R-VJ reading.) (We get the time of the day, in kaliis, at the beginning of the parva-nakfatra, that is, the Moon's nak1atra at the new or full moon.) (R¥Vl ll; Y-VJ 19)    Note 1. These kaliis are ca.lied Bhii"diina-kaliib, to be understood in the context, from the reference to it in Y-VJ 11 and the work done in y.VJ 21. (See Sn. V. 6, 9).Example. Find the kalOs at which the Moon's nakfatra at the 93rd parva begins.    From the previous example, the nak,s-atra-parts at pana is 93=11 x 8, plus 5, remainder. The ka!Os required=llx19-73x5=209-365, which, counted from the beginning of the previous day is (209+603)_:365=447 of the previous day.    The above result can be verified thus: The time of the day when the 93rd parva ends is 62 parts (as found in Note I to verse Y-VJ 14, Sn. V. 3) which is 62x603-;--124=301? koliis of time. The Moon's nak,s-atra¥parts gone is 93. Since each nak,s-atra takes 610 kalos to pass, to pass 93 it takes 93x6107124=457! kaliis. So the nak1atra begins at 457! koliis earlier than the 301? kalas of the day, which is 301?+603-457?=447 ka/Os of the previous day.    To clinch the matter, in addition to this verification, a proof might also be given. After each period of 17 panas, the Moon's nak1atras increase by 17X 67x27+ 124= 248+1/124, which gives rise to one part. 248 nalqatras take 248x6I0+603=250 days+530 kala.1'=251 days-73 kalas. This corresponds to one part. For 8 parts, it is 8:X:(-73)=-584=19, neglecting whole days,V. DAILY MHI, NAK?ATRA ETC,	59    Note 2. This verification itself shows that the emendation of dvi into tri 1s necessary and correct. Tilak has mistaken the meaning of the world udvapet as 'putt-ing in or adding', and made mistakes in his interpretation. Avapa means 'sowing or putting in', not udviipa which mean 'taking out', avapodwipa meaning 'putting in and taking out'. His interpretation will give an error of a few kalas, even after his unnecessary supplementation of this verse with verses R-VJ 12 (Y-VJ 27), R-VJ 13 and Y-VJ 16, (with several pages of explanation for this simple thing). This involved explanation itself must have told him that there is something wrong with his meaning, for he was transgressing his own dictum in bis Introduction. His taking the 8 parts mentioned not as it is, but as 12 parvas (the origin of the 8 parts), has added to his difficulties.    'Barhaspatya' has understood the meaning of udvapet correctly, but has made the same mistake in understanding Una as he has done in Y-VJ 15 (Sn. V. 4). He translates the second half as: "Introduce minus 72 kaliis in place of the subtrahend", which does not yield any meaning. In his proof, he has done the first part correctly, but to prove the second part, he has arbitrarily taken '6 circuits of the Moon', just to get - 72 kaliis given in the text. So he has not been able to realise that it must be- 73, not - 72.1.

Taking the remainder, and using it in the Jdvlldi series, the nak1atra current at the tithi must be found. (Y-VJ 20)Example. Find the nak$atra of the 8th tithi after the 93rd parva.8x 11+93 parts (got for 93 parvas)=181 (mod. 27)Applying the Jiiviidi series, the 19th, Maghii, is the nak!jatra of the 8th tithi.    Rough verification: Normally the Moon's nak1atra increases one per day, as also the tithi. So the 8th after Bharal)i, Maghii is the nalqatra required here.    Explanation: The rule given here is just to get the tithi-nak$afra by a reference to the Jiiviidi series. In this series, the consecutive numbers are the same as the parts (mod. 21) of the nalqatra given, The next na/qatra occurs 11 places away. The nalqatra60	VEDA.NGA 1YOTI?Anext to a given nakJatra will occur 11 places off, because 11 x 5 1/124=55 11/124= 1 I !/]24 (mod. 27). Now, roughly, successive tithis have successive nalqatras (the Uifference being 17 nakJatra-parts !css for every 5 tithis). So, if the tithis are multiplied by 11 and added to the parva-nak,1áatra-parts, we get the nakJatra equal to the number of tithis after the parva-nak,ffttra as the nak,?atra for that tithi. But, as mentioned above, the loss of 17 parts for every 5 tithis have to be subtracted from the parts of the parva-nahatra to get the actual parts of the tithi-nakJatra and this may make the tithi-nakJatra one less than what we get by this rule if the parva-parts are less than the correction.Example. Find the nakJatra of the end of 10 tithis after 36 parvas.    By Y-VJ 15, the nak,?atra-parts are 24 at parva. By this rule, 24+ ll X lO= 134= 26 (mod. 27). The 26th in the Jiiwidi is Jye.nhii. But the correct nak?atra is Anilriidhii 114 parts at the end of JO tithis. It is got thus: The required nak?atra and parts at parva=the naksatra and parts at parva (that is, Pu$ya 24 parts)+ 11 nak$atras- 17x 10---;--5 (=34 parts)=Aniiriidhii 114 parts.    Note I. We can see that this rule has been given simply by a desire to use the Jiiviidi for this purpose. Otherwise, the precise rule, which is easy, could have been given.    Tilak has got the idea correctly. But 'Barhaspatya', missing the meaning, has given an involved formula, needing a more involved explanation. Sudhakara Dvivedi, thinking that the formula must give the nak,rntra-parts also correctly (the parts are not given in this rule) has made drastic emendations in his usual way, with bhUta-satikhyii, which could never have been used by the author.1.

We get the parts of the day when the tithi ends, (which is the same as the position of the Sun in the diurnal circle (technically) called niir,llmal)dala) (divided into 124 parts). (R-VJ 20; Y-VJ 22)    Note !. Y-VJ 25 and 26 which follow, (Sn. V. 11, 12), deal purely with the Sun. The present verse faces both ways, on one side giving the time of the day when the tithi ends and, on the other side, the position of the Sun in the sky, that is, in the diurnal circle at that time.Example. What is the time of the day when the 8th tithi after the 93rd parva ends?Where is the Sun in the diurnal circle at that moment?    The time of the day=The time of the 93rd parva minus 8 x 2=62-16=46 parts of the day.    Dividing the diurnal circle into 124 parts, the Sun will be at the end of 46 parts counted from the east.    Note 2. 'B1i.rhaspatya', in his explanation, asks us to take for example, the Sun's diurnal position at parva to be 31. It can never be an odd number of parts. If he takes, as he does in his interpretation of Y-VJ J 6 (Sn. V. 5), that the parts are reckoned for each quarter-day separately, how are we to know in which quarter-day the parts lie'!62	VEDANGA JYOTI?A1 l.

(Y-VJ 25)Example. Find the Sun's nak,atra and parts at the end of the 8th tithi after the93rd parva.    According to the rule, (93 X 11+8 x 9)=8 full nak,atras and 103 parts. Adding 93 to the 8 full naJqatras elapsed since and counting from Sravi,1hti, we have 101 nak1atras and 103 parts in the next, i.e. the Sun is at the 103rd part of the 21st nak1atra, Vi/iikha, since 102=21 (mod. 27).    Note I. The R-VJ does not have this verse, perhaps feeling no need for the Sun's nakiatra. Even in Y-VJ 15 (Sn. V. 4) the purpose is, perhaps, only to get the Moon's nak1atra and parts, the Sun's nakiatra and parts onJy coming by the way. We can get the Sun's nak?áatras and parts envisaged in this verse by simply multiply-ing the tithis elapsed by 9 parts and adding it to the Sun's nak}áatra already found. For instance, adding 8x9=72 parts to Viiiikhii 31 pacts found in the example under Y-VJ 17-18 (Sn V. 6), we get Vi.¤iikhii 103 parts, found in the example here.    Note 2. 'Barhaspatya's' translation is defective, because saparva has been omitted. He says that the Sun's nakiatra is got by this verse. Without adding the m1mber of parvas as given by the expression saparJ1a, the nakfatras cannot be found because the whole nakfatra per parJ1a would be omitted taking only the parts. Also, his inter-pretation that two rules are given here, one for the parva and the other for the tithi, is also unnecessary, since the parva-nak1arra can be found simply by taking the tithi elapsed after that as zero.    Tilak remarks that yugalabdham does not mean dividing by 124 parts, but simply adding the two results of the first half. He is wrong, because saparva, meaning to add whole nalqatras elapsed, requires that the parts be converted into nakfatra.s. In another context, he himself wants the division. Further, we are not told that the two results are parts, and so the instruction to divide by 124 is necessary.V, DAILY TITHI, NAK?ATRA ETC.	6311.

Multiply the remainder by 2. This is termed the partial complement for the day's parts. Add to this the comple-ment for tithis, got as quotient, to obtain the total complement to be added to the day"s parts. Add the total complement to the nak,fatra-parts and divide by 1l. The result is the day before the completed day's parts when the nak,mtra began. (Y-VJ 26)    Example. The parts of the Sun's nak:jmra at tfze end of the 8th tithi after the 93rd parva is 103 of ViSiikhii. The parts of the day when this tithi ends is 46. Find the day and parts when Visiikhii began.    Since 103/9=11 and 4/9, the partial complement is 8/9. The quotient being 11, the complement due to the tithis is JI x 2=22. The total complement, i.e. 22 8/9, added to the parts of the day, viz. 46, is 46+22 8/9=68 8/9, and this is the completed parts of the day. Days for the !03 parts to pass=(l03+22+8/9)----;- ll= 11 4/9. So, Viliikhii began 11 4/9 days before the 68 8/9 parts of the day of the 8th tithi, i.e. l3 7/9 parts of the day of the 12th titlzi.    Note I. The translation given by me here, follows that suggested by Tilak, after examining the translations of Sudhakara and 'Biirhaspatya'. All agree in the final result. But Tilak's is a circumlocution because he wishes to use all the words in the verse. As it is, neglecting the last part, the rule can be given simply as: 'Divide the Sun's nak?atra-parts by 9. Double the 'result'. Add this to the parts of the day for which the naksaJra-parts are given. The day and parts, when the naksatra began is the 'result' taken as days before the added parts of the given tirhi-day.'    In the example, 103 are the parts of the nak1atra at 46 parts of the day of the 8th tithi. 103/9=11 4/9 is the 'result'. This doubled is 22 8/9. 46+22 8/9=68 8/9 are the increased parts of the day. The 'result' taken as days, i.e. ll 4/9 days, before 68 8/9 parts of the given (8th) tithi-day is I3 7/9 parts ofth.e 12th tithi-day, as already found.    Note 2. The explanation of the rule is as follows: The nak$afra-parts divided by 9 gives the tithi periods for the parts to go. But the number of tithis can be taken as the number of days if twice the number of tithis, taken as parts of a day, is sub-64	VEDA.NGA JYOTI?Atracted from it, because each tithi is two parts less than a day. But these days have to be subtracted from the given day and parts. So, twice the number of tithis, taken as parts, are added to the parts of the day and the number of tithis, taken as days, are subtracted from the point of the added parts of the day.    Note 3. It may be that some other rule is lurking in the last part where the division by 11 appears, not visible to us because of some corruption in this part.11.

When (nearly) half a zodiac has been got as rise, add one more part, and, as the second half is (nearly) completed, add another one. This result can be obtained by extending the navaka rule (already given for the ending moments of the parvas in Y-VJ 16: Sn. V. 5) (R-VJ 12; Y-VJ 27)    Note I. There are 367 risings of Sravi$fhii (or revolutions of the zodiac or sidereal days) in the year, while the civil days are 366. The defect in the sidereal day adds up to one sidereal day in the year, in which 124 parts of the zodiac rises. At the rate of one third part daily, for 366 civil days there will be 122 parts rising, the two parts remaining being due to neglecting the fraction, viz. 2/366 each day. This neglect is taken into account by adding one part every half year, during which one half of the zod'iac, or one half of the total nak,Mtras in the zodiac, would have risen.    Note 2. The navalca rule already seen follows this verse according to the R-VJ recension. It occurs next to verse 15 of the Y-VJ version, as verse 16, because the manner of computation in both is the same. There the tithi or parva unit is used to find the time-angle of Sravi?tha in daily parts and no neglected fraction is involved, but here the day-unit (so much part of the day) is used, and the fraction occurs. This will not matter, because, in actual practice, everything we got is only approximate or mean. In a note here, its extension to the tithi has been shown.Example. Find the time-angle of Sravif!ha after 122 days in the year.V. DAILY TITH!, NAK?ATRA ETC.	65    One-third of 122 is 40-;. For neglecting the fraction we may add 2/3, since we are asked to add one per half year, and make it 41! to be exact, though the rule here envisages only whole parts. Thus we have 41 parts.11.

The civil day is sub-tractable from the solar day (i.e. less than the latter). This defect, combined with the defect in the lunar day causes one extra month at the end of the half-yuga and another extra month at the end of the yuga. (Y-VJ 37).    Note I. In the ha!f-yuga there are 900 solar days, 915 civil days and 930 lunar deys. So, in the one to one correspondence between the solar end the lunar months one extra month has to be added at the end of each half-yuga to fit the lunar year reckoning with the solar year reckoning just as one more day is given to the civil year of 365 days to fit in with the correct year, once in four years, though even this is a little rough.11.

In 93 parvas, 7 full ayanas have elapsed and 6 parvas and 3 tithis have passed in the 8th ay{1J'la, which is a dak?it){Jyana. 6x 15+3=93 tithis, remain in this ayana. Since 1 tithi is day minus 2 parts, 93 tithis arc 91} days. There-fore, the day-time by the given rule is: (91}x2-;--6J)+l2=15 muhiirtas. In fact, this is the autumnal equinox.    i. In 54 panas, 4 ayanas have elapsed and in the 5th ayana, an uttariiya,:,a, 4 parvas and 6 tithis have also passed. Now, 4x 15+6=66 tithis=64 days. So the day-time is (64x2-;-6I)+l2=14-lr muhiirtas=28 niir:jis and 12 viniir/is.11. UPAVAMTHA AND INTERCALARY DAYSText 40caturdOSim upavasathas tathii bhavet yathadito dinam upaiti candramiibf miighOSukliihniko yurikte Sraviifhiiyiim ca viir#kim/lR-VJ 34That Caturdasi tithi on which the Moon rises just after the Sun has risen is the day of the Upavasatha. Any characteristic of the first day of the bright fortnight of the month of Miigha links the flll}qatra of the last day of the pre-vious year (viz. Sravat;1a) with Sravisthii, (that is, it is common to both). (R-VJ 34).V. DAILY TITH!, NAK?ATRA ETC.	67Note l. This verse is not found in the y. VJ.Note 2. Upavasatha day is the day of which the previous day is the iidhiina ordik?ii day, that day itself is the pi,;rjapitryajfia day and the next day is the i,?/i day.    Note 3. The Moon rising just after sunrise indicates that the time is near new moon. By contrast, if the Moon rises before sunrise, and becomes what is technically called Udár4r/a all excepting the Viijasaneyins and Baudhliyanas have to perform an expiatory rite to nullify the evil that will acrue and perform punariidhiina if the iidhiina had been done on the previous day. The next day will be the upai,asatha and the next the ini day. This shows how careful the priests would have been to avoid such a thing happening and, naturally, they must have had rules, formed from long observation, to fix the religious calendar tolerably well, using the system of the VedUffga Jyoti1a as framework.    Note 4. The second half of the verse suggests how the conditions of the first half can arise. On account of the lunar year being shorter by 11 days, and this accumulating to almost one month before intercalation is made, the nak?atra of the first day of Magha. can be Sraval).a or even Uttara?ii9ha. Even at the end of the yuga, the new yuga can begin with part of Sraval).a, because actually the 62 lunar months of the yuga take 1830.8965 days, not 1830 days, as the latter has been adopted just for civil convenience. Therefore, all the characteristics like nak,lafra and its endings will apply better to the first day of the next yuga. This will vitiate the characteristics of all the days of the next yuga and also accumulate yuga after yuga. Thus, the civil calendar will wander farther and farther away from the religious calendar. This can be avoided if the day next to the 1830 days of the yuga is not reckoned and the next day to that is taken as the first day of the new yuga. In fact, this day will be an inter-calary day made at the end of each yuga. It is this that is suggested by the second half of the verse.BIBLIOGRAPHYi.
