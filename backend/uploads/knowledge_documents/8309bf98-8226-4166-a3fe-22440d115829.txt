The answer is." No, it is no repetition at all. What wa; stated.before without the aid of Ashtakavar,_ga Table relates to the cancellation of two similar effects but of a eontrary character. For exampl~, a planet in one capacity may o~.a giver of wealth ; the ~ame planet 859 . .....,..._ in: another capacity ·may c~use loss of...wealth. In sucl;i. a case, both the effects are similar in ch~racter apd become neutralised with the consequence that the native neither :acquires wealth nor incurs any losses. But if, the planet's capacity to give wealth be . in any way stronger fo~ mo.re rearnns than one, the same will of course predominate over the ·oppo~ite current (of the other effect) and the result will be an influx of so~e money. In the present verse it has been stated that there is· cancellation in th~ case of good and bad effects even if they are· not similar in nat~re. This view is· .further supported by <fl'{{l.:ftJT• (Badarayana) and ?:!'cr.r (Yavana) as they have admitted this principle while speaking about Ashtakavargas an<l their several effec·ts. Thus, for example, a cer_tain planet may be the g.iver of gold on account of a certain reason. The same _planet may on account of some other reason cause loss in silver. : Though. the effects in these two cases are uot similar (because both are not in respe::t to gQld, nor to silver), merely on account of the effects being opposite in nature (one giving ·and the other taking away), the result is neither· benefic, nor malefic. After sqch considera,tions of each Rasi on acc0unt of _its 8 countings, if it is found that beuefi~ points outnumber the· n~alefic, the eflect of the planet on _that Rasi should be d~~lared a;:; benefic_ to the extent of the excess benefic dots as already stated. •NQw the follo~ing qw.estion 1Tiay be asked: vVeH, if Ashtaka· varga then is so important for ascertaining the nature of the-effects, what was the necessity for Varahamihira treating separately in his Brihat Samhita the 1TR!R1M5'(Gocharaphala) of planets with respect to the Moon's place at birth? The answer is, the inten.tion of Varahamihira is that such of the effects which have not' been stated in connection with the Ashtakavarga should. be stated in the ilR-l'R:(Gochara). Further, as m;:,rr~(Gochara) is wide-known to· all, and as it has been treated of by many authorc; in their works, it has to be inferred·that Varahamihira foo has adopted.fb,e same course followed by. his predecessors.

Some methods of simplifying this· work have been· suggested in the past, · but a new contrivance has now been devised which has several merits. It not only does away ~ith the patient labor i:lvolved in the dull and rout:ine process, ~ut ~lso shows the results in such a way that one can see at a glan~e how the • benefic dots iµ any p~rticular house have been contributed. The f!cfl~ffl (Sarvashta.ka varga) figures can also .be very easily read from the plates at a g~ance. The practicai _uses to whkh the .results. can b,e: put are, as is known to astrol?gers, several. The more import_a~t of these uses have been ~xplained in this Adhyaya i~ the~r appropriate p]_aces. • The constrnction of the· Ashtakavnrga plate and the method · of reading the results from the_ sa,me :will' now be explained .. 0 The contrivance. c?nsists • of ~i~_e circular· pla~e§ (di~cs".of zinc, copper or brass), of_ successively larger. radii placed one· 0 ver the other in the order of-their size, the largest b~i-ag·placed at the bottom and the smaUest at' _the top. A x:acliusof one inch 661 f.or tl~e smallest anc\ three inches for the largest, the difference between the radii of successive plates being .th of an inch will be found suit;tble. Tbe bottom-most plate has an axle with screw. arrangement ·fixed_ to its centre about which the other. plates revolve. By tightening the screw at the top, the plates can b/ fixed.up in any desired position. Each plate covers the central portion of the nex~ bigger plate, exposing to view only a circular strip or rim. The top plate is of couq,e fully exposed. The top plate ~nd the narro~ strips of othel· plates are each divided into 12 equal parts. The dividing lines are so drawn that they form a straight line when the plates are adjusted for any· horoscope. The twelve divisions of the top plate are assigned to' the twelve signs of the :1.odiac. In the visible ri1i1 of . the next bigger plate are arranged the figures indi_cating the benefic dot~· coun:te~ from the Sun in the several Ashtakavarga:s. The next plate contains figures of benefic dots counted from the Moon; ·and' th~ ne.xt one, from Mars; _'and. so ·on in the order of "the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercu·ry, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and the Lagna:· One of the divisions of each of these plates contains a dot clenofing· the position of the planet to which the plate relates. Thus the dot in the largest plate indicates the position of the Lagoa. To adjust the plates.for any horoscope, keep the bottom-most plate in position and rotate the next plate (relating to Saturn) until the division containing the dot is as many divisions removed from the dot in the Lagna plate as Saturn is removed from the Lagoa in the horoscope under consideration, For example, if Saturn occupies the 8th house from the Lagna, move. the plate relating to Saturn till its dot comes to the 8th division from the dot in the Lagna plate. Then hold the two plates in position firmly and proceed similarly with the third plate• Then hold the three plates in position and proceed with the fourth and so on. \:Yhen the Sun's plate also has been thus fixed, rotate the topmost plate until the name of the particular Rasi representing the Lagna in the horoscope under eonsideFatiqn is brought clir~i:tly above the divi· sion 9ontaining the dot in the Lagna plate.

They are now: ready for reading the results. The ' 1 's indicate benefic-·dots relating to the Sun's Ashtakavarg~ ; the ' 2 's indicate those rela..ting to the Moon's, and so on. The number of ' 1 's in the several plates in the 'Mesha' division represents the benefic dots in the Ashtakavarga of the S:;n in that division; the num.ber -of ' 1 's in the several plates opposite to 'Vrishabha' representing _the benefic dots in-the Sun's Ashtakavarga in .Vrishabha and so_on, Si~ilarly, the number _of' 2 'sin the divisions of the plates OP'()OSit~ to 'Mesha' represents the benefic dots iri the Ashtakavarga of the Moon in ' Mesha;' the number of '2 's in the parts of the viates ~pposite to 'Vrishabha,' the benefic dots in the Ashtaklivarga of. the Moon in 'Vrishabha;' and so on. The number of '3 'swill similarly yield the results for M 1.rs, '4 's for Mercury, '5 's for Jupiter, '6 's for Venus and '7 \; for Saturn. The figure in the next page shows the plate properly arranged for the positions of the planets in the sample horoscope given below:.:_ It wil~ be . see~ that the dotted di~ision • of the plate relating· to the Sun bas been brought -agai!}st Kataka. as the Su~ occupie~ Kataka in K~_?dali (ijiuJ&:Jr) of· the plate··the ; ·the ·dotted. p:irt ~~'I:.~~= -~~..,... ................. ...~...,...~..,~......,..-.,.,,,.....,,._..,......,.. relating to the Moon has ,been arranged against Mithuna as the Moon:;..occupies ·Mjthuna; the dotted part of the plate relating to Mars has been brought against Simha as he occupies Simha; and so on. •. It ·will further be observed that there are six ' 1 's in the divisions against Mesha, four in the divisions against Vrishabha'., and so on. ·Similarly, there are five '2's against Mesha, four '2 's against Vrishabha, and so on. These represent benefi:c dots in the Ashtakavargas of tlie Sun, the Moon, etc., in the. several houses. The number of figures (irrespective of what planet they relate to) in the several divisions against a particular house indicates the Samudaya Ashtakavarga (~~~<!icflT) in that hquse. For example, it will be found that there are 34 figures in the divisions against Mesha. 34 is therefore the number of benefic· • dQts in Mesha in t~e Samudaya Ashtakvarga.

(Note that the Sun in exaltation causes maximu·m labor and maximum income ; the same when the other malefi_cs are posited in the tenth hou~e] If more than one planet be strong, then the native will have more than one source of income. The profession or occup~-tion of a native is generally judged from the planet or planets occupying the tenth house and, if there should be none there, from those in th~ 1st and afso ·from those aspecting the Sun and the Moon.

For the purposes of this ~;ur~ daya, the 27 stars from Aswini to Revati are classi&ed into nine groups of three each, the five odd• groups or triads ·b~i~g .styied ~f<xl'(Savya) or ?..'~tl'f(Daksbina) and· the four even ci~es as ~lxf, (Apasavya) ;.rm (Varna) or :a'ij"{ (Uttara).

XVII. ~~~-~~~------.The follo~ing hints may give a clue to the law governing the assignment of the mahadasas to the several Nakshatra padas. In a~ (Savya cbakra) the mabadasas begin from Mesha onwards to Meena and thence they pass on to Vrischika and go in a reverse order up to Dbanus and tbe~ce ~eve_rt to Mesha and end in Meena. Thus we have had. 3 cycles representing 36 mahadasas for the first four Rasyamsas ( OO~ ) or the first nakshatra of a triad. The 4th cycle begins w_ith Vrischika and passing on inn reverse order ends in Dhanus. The 5th cycle runs from Mesha to lVIeena. ' the 6th-from Vrischika backward to Dhanus,-These three cycles• give the kalacliakra dasas to the four -nakshatra padas comprising the second star of a~ (Savya) triad. The 7th, 8th. ·and 9th cycles are•identical with the 1st, 2nd and 3rd cycles respectively Tnus it will be seen that thr:! four padas of the 3rd star of a ~ (Savva) triad have ~he same mabadasas as those of the first. There are nine c~•cles also corresponding to the twelve padas of an~~ (.".pasavya) triad, but with this difference. The cycles in this chakra run .in an order exactly the opposite of what obtains in ·the~ (Savya chakra'. The first cycle begins with Dha• nus and ends with Vrischika. The second runs from ·Meena to Mesba in the reverse order. The third passes from Dhanus to Vrischika.identically with the 1st. These· three cycles assign the mahadasa to the first four padas comprising -~he fir~t nak~hatra of an ;j{~ ·(Apasavya) triad. _The 4th an4 the. 6th cycles are identical with. the 2n.d, i. e;, from Meena ~n a r_everse order t~ Mesh<J.while the 5th is with the Ist or the lrd, i. e., from Dh~nus to Vrischika.· These three.enable us to find the ~ahadasas of the .middie four pada~ 'for~i~g. the second star of an 3ltR'r-xf(Apasavya) ...  •  • I  tr~a~..
