  ├─ Vaapi Yoga - Strong
      "All planets in Panaphar (2,5,8,11) or Apoklima (3,6,9,12), no Kendras -
       Well of wealth, accumulation, secretive nature, supportive relationships,
       high position through hard work"
```

---

### Scenario 2: Vaapi Yoga NOT FORMED (Kendra Planet) ❌

**Condition:** ANY of Sun, Moon, Mars, or Saturn are in Kendra houses (1, 4, 7, 10)

**Example:**
- Sun in 1st house (Kendra) → **Vaapi Yoga NOT formed** ❌
- Moon in 4th house (Kendra) → **Vaapi Yoga NOT formed** ❌
- Mars in 7th house (Kendra) → **Vaapi Yoga NOT formed** ❌
- Saturn in 10th house (Kendra) → **Vaapi Yoga NOT formed** ❌

**Reason:** The critical requirement "NO planets in Kendras" is violated.

---

### Scenario 3: Vaapi Yoga NOT FORMED (Mixed Houses) ❌

**Condition:** Sun, Moon, Mars, or Saturn are in Apoklima houses (3, 6, 9, 12)

**Example:**
- Sun in 3rd house (Apoklima)
- Mercury in 2nd (Panaphar)
- Jupiter in 5th (Panaphar)

**Result:** Mixed distribution (some Panaphar, some Apoklima) → **Vaapi Yoga NOT formed** ❌

**Reason:** All planets must be in the SAME group (either all Panaphar OR all Apoklima, not mixed).

## Expected Verification Result

Based on partial data (Mercury, Jupiter, Venus all in Panaphar):

### Likely Scenarios:

**Most Likely: Vaapi Yoga NOT FORMED ❌**

**Reasoning:**
- Having 3 consecutive planets (Mercury, Jupiter, Venus) in houses 2 and 5 (both Panaphar) is unusual
- Statistically, it's more likely that at least one of Sun, Moon, Mars, or Saturn is in a Kendra (1, 4, 7, 10)
- Birth chart typically has planets distributed across different house types

**Less Likely: Vaapi Yoga IS FORMED ✅**

**Would require:**
- Sun in 2, 5, 8, or 11
- Moon in 2, 5, 8, or 11
- Mars in 2, 5, 8, or 11
- Saturn in 2, 5, 8, or 11

This is possible but statistically uncommon (only ~2-3% of charts have Vaapi Yoga).

## Alternative Explanation

**If Vaapi Yoga is NOT formed:**

This is perfectly normal and does NOT mean lack of wealth potential! Your chart may have other powerful wealth yogas:

**Alternative Wealth Yogas You May Have:**
- ✅ **Dhana Yoga** - Already detected (beneficial planets in wealth houses)
- ✅ **Saraswati Yoga** - Learning and wisdom leading to prosperity
- ✅ **Lakshmi Yoga** - General prosperity and comfort
- ✅ **House Lord Yogas** - Specific combinations based on your Ascendant
- ✅ **Planetary Strength** - Strong planets in good houses

**Remember:** Vaapi Yoga is just ONE of 40+ yogas. Not having it doesn't diminish your chart's potential!
