# Screenshots Directory

This directory is for sharing screenshots and images during development.

## Usage

Place your screenshots here so they can be easily accessed and reviewed.

Supported formats:
- PNG (.png)
- JPG/JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- GIF (.gif)

## Example

Copy screenshots from your Mac to this directory:
```bash
cp ~/Desktop/your-screenshot.png /Users/arvind.tiwari/Desktop/jioastro/screenshots/
```

Or drag and drop files into this folder in your file explorer.

## Note

These files are included in `.gitignore` to avoid cluttering the repository with large binary files.
